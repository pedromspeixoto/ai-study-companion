Initial, small-scale \nautomations grow to support large-scale \norchestration needs. Eventually, \norganizations recognize the need for \ndedicated ownership—a team or individual \ntasked with building and maintaining a \nscalable platform to support their \nautomation and data pipeline requirements.\nWhile organizations may have very similar \ndata needs, headcount, and workflows, it’s \ncommon for the platforms they build to be \nsignificantly different. This is because no \ndistinct solution exists for building a data \nplatform. This can come down to decisions \nabout their cloud provider, preference for \nopen or closed-source software, and budget. \nAlthough the underlying technologies \nmay be unique, these organizations often \nfollow common, well-known patterns and \nprinciples to design their data platforms. \nWe will review some of those patterns and \nprinciples in this e-book. \nDagster believes in an open data platform \nthat is heterogeneous and centralized. It \nshould support specific business use cases \nand accommodate various data storage \nand processing tools, all while providing a \ncentral unified control plane across all of the \nprocesses in the organization.\nIntroduction\nOnly one data platform should exist in an \norganization. While a single platform may \nrequire a larger upfront investment, the \nstandardization it provides and productivity \nboost for the team pay dividends as the \nplatform grows.\nAn extensible platform provides better \nbusiness alignment and less duplicated work. \nFor more information on what Dagster believes \nabout data platforms, see the “What Dagster \nBelieves About Data Platforms”  blog post.\nThis book will be a comprehensive guide \nfor data platform owners looking to build a \nstable and scalable data platform, starting \nwith the fundamentals:\nArc hite cting your Data \nPlatform\nDesign Patterns and Tools\nObservability\nData Quality\nFinally, we’ll tie it together with real-world \nexamples illustrating how different teams \nhave built in-house data platforms for \ntheir businesses. \n01 | Data Platforms\n04\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n05\nYou can find the Dagster team’s internal \nOpen Data Platform on GitHub . Throughout \nthis e-book, you’ll see how Dagster’s core \ntenet of building open-source software can \nhelp establish the standards for a scalable, \nmaintainable, and stable data platform.\nThis book is for data practitioners interested \nin building and maintaining a data platform. \nYou may be a team of one or part of an \nestablished team with a growing area of \nresponsibility. In either case, common issues, \npatterns, and needs are core to building a \ndata platform. This book will help you \nnavigate those topics and establish a data \nplatform that evolves alongside your business.\nMost data tools fall into two categories: \nall-in-one solutions or unbundled tools. One \nof the biggest criticisms of the Modern Data \nStack is that its design over-indexes on \nunbundled tools, requiring teams to stitch \ntogether a large number of specialized tech \nto address problems historically managed by \nlarger, managed platforms.\nIs it really necessary to adopt a dozen tools \nto do what was previously managed by \nonly a handful? The problem is not deciding \nwhich tools you need but how to integrate \nthose tools into a cohesive whole.\nAn Open Data Platform\nWhy do we need data platforms?\nUnbundling your entire stack reveals one \nmajor weakness–maintaining consistency \nand control over various tooling choices \nand access points. Addressing this flaw is \nthe fundamental purpose of building a \ndata platform.\nIt helps us bridge the gap between a fully \nunbundled data stack and a singular, closed \nplatform. And it all comes down to the \ncontrol plane.\n01 | Data Platforms\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n06\nThe control plane is more than orchestration. \nFor many orchestrators, the ability to \nschedule and initiate jobs is the bulk of what \nthey provide. Data Platforms require more \nthan that.\nTraditionally, the control plane is used to \nconfigure and activate the data plane. This \nis perhaps the most critical piece of the \ndata platform puzzle. It provides a standard \nof control and enables a single view of all \ninputs into and outputs of your platform.\nThe Control Plane\nThe control plane extends beyond creating \nand modifying datasets; it can connect \nassets across various systems, resources, \nand tools. Knowing if your scheduled job \nfailed or alerted you on a failed data quality \ncheck is only somewhat useful. Knowing \nthe data lineage of that failure downstream \nis far more important than the simple \nobservation that “it failed.” \nThis is the marriage of orchestration, \nmetadata, and observability, and it is the \ncore value-add for most data platforms. \nIn many cases, this requires various tools, \nwhich must be integrated.\n01 | Data Platforms\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n07\nThe flexibility of an unbundled Data Stack \ncan quickly evolve from a value-add initiative \nto a maintenance burden. Separate—though \nintegrated—tools often develop opaque and \nbrittle dependencies. An upstream change may \nhave an unexpected impact far downstream.\nTesting alone is not the solution to making \nsure various tools work well together. The \ntrue culprit is often disparate codebases and \na disjointed developer experience. Many tools \noften mean many repos, poorly documented \ndependencies, and an increasingly complex \nsystem architecture which leads to siloing \nwithin teams and organizations.\nThese are common problems for many \ncompanies and familiar headaches for all \ndata engineers.\nThankfully, a centralized data platform helps \naddress these issues holistically with your \nteam’s and system’s common language: code.\nIn software engineering there is the concept \nof code encapsulation .  This idea is also \nprevalent in establishing a data platform. \nWhile the organization operates within a \nsingle data platform, individual contributors, \nlike data scientists, analysts, data engineers, \nand machine learning engineers, can operate \nwith freedom from within their own \nsubdivisions of the platform.\nData platforms help manage and orchestrate \nworkflows, so it is reasonable to expect “code \nlocations” to include both the logical \ncomponents of a workflow and the \nconfiguration related to that workflow. \nManaging a variety of jobs in disparate \nsystems makes this incredibly difficult. As the \ncomplexity of the jobs grows, this becomes \nincreasingly difficult. A centralized platform \nthat introduces standardized workflow \npatterns and provides a shared interface for \nmultiple jobs is a primary benefit of establishing \na data platform. The enforcement of \nstandards by the platform owner enables \nthem to ensure improved validation and \nsupport of the platform as a whole.\nBenefits of Data Platforms\n01 | Data Platforms\nIn the context of data engineering, \n“code encapsulation”  refers to the \npractice of bundling together the \nfunctions that operate on, and generate, \ndata into a single unit, typically in the \nform of modules or classes. This practice \nhelps in managing code complexity, \nmaintainability, and promoting reusability.\nNote\n--- Page 8 ---\n08\nObservability and developer experience are \ntwo other key benefits of a data platform, \nalongside code locations and encapsulation. \nThey are also the common threads that help \nelevate your pipelines from miscellaneous \ncode sets to a stable and mature platform.\nWe’ll explore these topics in later chapters, \nbut observability can take multiple forms. At \nits core, observability is the ability to \nreasonably inspect what is happening on the \nplatform. This includes changes to your \nsystem inputs, changes in the outputs over \ntime, and other details about the inner \nworkings of your platform. The Data Visibility \nPrimer  is another great resource on this topic.\nThese elements contribute to the \ndeveloper’s experience on the data platform. \nThe biggest pitfall of data platforms - or any \nlarge data infrastructure initiative - is an \ninconsistent experience. This applies to both \nthe creation of new features and datasets \nwithin the platform and the maintenance of \nexisting features and datasets. Without the \nability to share standards across your code \nlocations, and have a clear view of the \nworkings of the platform, your developer \nexperience will suffer. As a result, your \nteam’s velocity will suffer, and your data \nplatform will likely fail to provide the value \nyou expect.\nObservability and Developer \nExperience\n01 | Data Platforms\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nArchitecting \nYour Data \nPlatform\n02\n--- Page 10 ---\n10\nData Platforms often \ncomprise many tools.\nIndependently, these tools solve discrete \nproblems. Collectively, however, they \nprovide the means to solve broader pain \npoints common to data teams and technical \norganizations: inconvenient data silos, poor \ndata quality, and ever-changing stakeholder \nrequirements can make delivering value \ndifficult. But, these challenges can be \naddressed holistically - and preemptively - \nwhen architecting your data platform. \nStrong consideration for system design at \nthe inception of your project is crucial, as \nearly architecture decisions can influence \nthe effectiveness of your platform: for \nexample, risk of vendor lock-in, scalability \nlimitations, and maintenance overhead. \nDesign decisions and tooling selections \nshould also scale with your team’s and your \ncompany’s growth. It can seem daunting \nwhen taken at face value, but established \ndesign patterns make this process much \nmore manageable. \nThis chapter will review the configurations, \ntooling, and architectures that the data \nteam should consider. Whether starting \nfrom square one or rearchitecting a legacy \nsystem, you can set yourself up for success \nby being intentional and thoughtful about \nthe overall system.\n02 | Architecting Your Data Platform\n10\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n11\nData Platforms need to \ngrow and evolve with the \nbusiness. If data platform \ndevelopment stagnates \nwhile the business is still \nchanging, it’s likely a \nbyproduct of poor \narchitecture and overly \nrigid design. \nA centralized data platform is the best way \nto ensure stability and consistency across all \nyour data initiatives. Designing an extensible \nplatform will allow you to keep up with the \nbusiness’s changing demands.\nThe architecture of your platform establishes \nwhich kinds of data access patterns are \npossible for the rest of the organization. The \ndata platform, and data teams, must be able \nto meet the needs of the numerous \nstakeholders across organizational teams. \nThese can manifest as any number of data \ndeliverables, whether those be dashboards, \ndata exports or machine learning models. \nThese expectations need to be understood \nearly on. If you expect consumers to only \ninterface with the platform through BI \ntools, you should facilitate a design that \nensures data is readily available through \nthat entry point. \nIf data is primarily shared via APIs or batch \nexports, your platform should support that \nas a primary feature. These entry points can \nevolve over time, but you should expect to \nsupport any platform’s new entry point for \nthe long term. \nMaking it easy for users to consume data \nthrough a BI tool can be a double-edged \nsword. Often, “self-service” is the goal, but \nwithout strong controls on structure and \naccess, you introduce the possibility of \nmisuse and misinterpretation of the data \nthat’s been made available. Centralized data \nplatforms improve this through transparency \nof data usage, lineage to better understand \ndata origin, and higher quality data through \nend-to-end pipeline validation.\nThese details must be considered when \ndesigning your platform’s internals and \nthe entry points for your customers \nand stakeholders.\nScaling with the Business\n02 | Architecting Your Data Platform\n--- Page 12 ---\n12\nRapidly growing datasets, tightened SLAs, \nand prohibitive costs are common drivers for \nplatform redesign and architecture overhauls. \nA composable and extensible platform \nmakes meeting these requirements possible \nwithout an expensive redesign. \nRequirements often change at organizations \nand the data platform needs to be able to \nreact. A startup may find that as they grow \nand their data volume increases, their initial \nset of tools are no longer able to handle the \nadditional traffic.\nAs the lifespan of the tools within a data \nplatform are tied to the needs of the \nbusiness, the goal should not be to avoid \nplatform changes but to design a \nplatform that makes operating under this \nconstraint manageable.\nComposability and \nExtensibility\n02 | Architecting Your Data Platform\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n13\nIf you build an extensible and composable \nplatform, you can continue to operate at a \nhigh level with minimal downtime. You also \nafford yourself the flexibility of updating \nyour platform without migrating major \nsystem components. \nChanging transformation tooling, pipeline \ndesign, and migrating data stores are common \nactivities for any Data Platform Owner. The \nease with which you can execute those \nchanges depends on the platform’s design.\nWhat does an extensible platform look like \nin the real world? Often, it comes down \nto abstractions. \n02 | Architecting Your Data Platform\nComposability and Extensibility\nIn object-oriented design and \nsoftware architecture, the principle \nto “prefer composition over \ninheritance”  advocates for reusability \nand organization of code over \nheavy reliance on inheritance.  With \ninheritance code can become tightly \ncoupled leading to fragility and \ninflexibility. Whereas with composition, \nthere is a loose coupling between code \nreferences, thus leading to improved \nmaintenance, and often clearer and \nmore understandable code.\nNote\nYou probably have heard the phrase “prefer \ncomposition over inheritance” .  in the \ncontext of software application design. This \napplies to data platform design in much the \nsame way, in that the composition of a data \nplatform typically comprises multiple \npurpose-built tools.\nOften the composition of data tools is \nabstracted and hidden from the downstream \nanalysts, and data engineers, allowing for \nthese individuals to be more efficient in \ncompleting their tasks. Data engineering is \nsoftware engineering after all, and the \ndesign and composition of tools, pipelines, \nand models, should be aligned with software \nengineering best practices.\nComposability and extensibility are key \ncomponents of a well-architected data \nplatform, and something we will cover in \nmore detail later in these writings.\n--- Page 14 ---\n14\nHistorically, data architectures were \nconsiderably simpler than what you see \ntoday. As the data needs of organizations \nhave become more demanding, the underlying \ntechnologies have evolved to meet them: \ndata needs to be more real time, with higher \nvolume, and through more and more \nsophisticated modelling.\nIn recent years, a proliferation of tools has \nemerged to handle the specialized \nrequirements of data processing and modelling, \nand a bundling of these tools has been \ndefined with the name of the “Modern Data \nStack”. Many teams have become frustrated \nwith the modern data stack, and its many \nvendors, and  critics often stress that these \nnew tools introduce undue complexity, and \nsome of those concerns are warranted.\nBut there is no denying that the wide range \nof data tooling has lent itself to a range of \narchitectures previously unavailable. Let’s \nlook at some of those data architectures and \ncritical components of each design.\nExtract-Transform\nLoad (ETL)\nE xtract-Load\nTransform (EL T)\nD ata Lakehouses\nE vent-Driven\nCommon Data Architectures\n02 | Architecting Your Data Platform\n01\n02\n03\n04\n--- Page 15 ---\n15\nThis architecture is the simplest and \noldest approach of this list. Data \nstarts from an origin datastore, often a \nproduction database, and is transformed \nin transit before being written to a final \nstorage mechanism. Typically, you’ll see \naggregations and other denormalization \napplied to these datasets before they are \nwritten to their final destination. \nCommon Data Architectures\n02 | Architecting Your Data Platform\nBy design, the state of the data in its “final” \nform is different from what is extracted from \nits origin. This design is still commonplace, \nand can be quite effective at reducing \ncompute usage at the destination. The \ntradeoff is that you may lose the granularity \nof data, and your downstream usage is \nlimited by the logic applied in transit.\nExtract-Transform-Load (ETL)\n--- Page 16 ---\n16\n02 | Architecting Your Data Platform\nThis design has grown dramatically in \npopularity thanks to the Modern Data Stack \nand its modular design. It has also become \ncommonplace thanks to the advent of \nMassively Parallel Processing databases and \ntheir modern counterparts. \nInstead of applying transformations to your \ndata before it lands in your warehouse, \nyou retain a raw copy of that data as it \narrives. This design pattern lends to various \nextraction methodologies, including change \ndata capture (CDC) and ingestion of data \nfrom APIs or file servers. As an example, \nin the case of CDC, all of the operations \nthat are performed on a dataset, like a \ntable in Postgres, are captured and loaded \ninto storage. Then, that data can be re-\nconstructed in the transformation step, \nreconstituting the original dataset from the \noperations that took place. Comparing this \nto “ETL”, the raw change capture would be \nlost as the transformation would take place \nas the data is loaded into storage.\nBecause the raw data is retained, it is \npossible to recreate the transformations \nand models of this data, ultimately providing \nmore flexibility. But, this also results in \nadditional computation, and increased \nstorage costs.\nCommon Data Architectures\nExtract-Load-Transform (EL T)\n--- Page 17 ---\n17\n02 | Architecting Your Data Platform\nThe Data Lakehouse architecture is relatively \nnew, but its underlying components have \nbeen around for many years. \nData Lakehouses provide the scale of data \nlakes with the structure of data warehouses. \nTheir design allows for large-scale data \nprocessing and storage, with most of the “heavy \nlifting” done outside the data warehouse.\nTypically, data is written to columnar file formats \nlike Parquet and stored in cloud storage like \nS3 or GCS. Recently, Iceberg, Delta, and Hudi \nformats have also been gaining popularity. In \nthe case of Delta, this is an additional layer on \ntop of Parquet in which additional metadata \nand transaction logs are included, enabling \nsupport for ACID (atomicity, consistency, \nisolation, durability) transactions.\nSee a term you’re not \nfamiliar with? Be sure to \ncheck out the Dagster \ndata engineering glossary.\nThese files typically follow a Medallion \nArchitecture, which we’ll cover in more detail \nlater in this book. These systems often \nuse specialized analytics engines, such as \nSpark, to transform the data in these files \ninto clean and consumable datasets. The \nfinal output is often written for use in a \ndata warehouse or otherwise exposed to \ndownstream consumers. \nCommon Data Architectures\nData Lakehouses\n--- Page 18 ---\n18\n02 | Architecting Your Data Platform\nStreaming and “real-time” data platforms \nblend event-driven design patterns \nwith some of the components of the \narchitectures mentioned above. \nIn an event-driven paradigm, services \nexchange data and initiate their workload \nthrough external triggers rather than relying \non the coordination provided by a signal \norchestrator. Some examples of triggers \ninclude messages landing in a Kafka \nmessage queue, a call to a web hook, or an \nS3 event notification.\nThese architectures often use specialized \ntools to enable steam processing for real-\ntime and rolling-window transformations. \nThis approach is often paired with the \nLakehouse architecture to serve analytical \nworkflows for a wide range of SLAs. \nOften streaming can be paired with batch \nprocessing, in that rolling computations can \ntake place on the event stream, and persisted \nevents landing in cloud storage can be later \nbatch processed for additional reporting.\nSome considerations of stream based \nprocessing is the expected cost of long-\nrunning compute, the additional complexity \nof event processing, and the requirement \nfor specialized tools that may not conform \nto the existing tools being used at your \norganization. However, when real-time \nanalytics are required for insights that need \nto happen fast, like fraud detection, then \nstreaming is a fantastic option.\nCommon Data Architectures\nEvent-Driven\n--- Page 19 ---\n03\nDesign\nPatterns\n--- Page 20 ---\n20\nAs we know, addressing your business’s \ndata needs is at the core of your data \nplatform. To do this, we need to capture \nand process data. Pipeline designs may be \nconstrained by the tools you use within your \nplatform, but don’t be fooled by shiny or new \ntechnologies. There are only a finite number \nof data pipeline patterns that you can use to \nfind, ingest, and process new datasets for \nuse downstream. \nCountless tools can help you process new \ndata, but only a handful of fundamental \npatterns exist. \nWhether your data platform is entirely \nnascent or quite mature, the pipelines \npowering your platform can fall into one of\nthese three categories:\nThere may be layers of abstraction built on top \nof these patterns, but the fundamental \nimplementations will fall into one of these \napproaches. We won’t be going into much \ndepth in this chapter about pipeline \nabstractions, but you can find more details \nabout Dagster’s approach to abstractions here.  \nThese categories are not unique to data \nengineering; any software engineer who has \nworked on system integrations, consumed \nwebhooks from a third-party application, \nor interacted with a REST API should find \nthese familiar. However, certain patterns \ncan be found quite frequently within a data \nplatform, which we have seen through our \nexperiences implementing data platforms \nat various organizations, and through \nrelationships with data tooling customers.\nDesign Patterns for Data \nPipelines\n03 | Design Patterns\n01\n02\n03\nPush\nPull\nPoll\n--- Page 21 ---\n21\nFor pipelines that are based on the push \nmethodology, the consumer is required to \nwait for data to be pushed from a source \nsystem; the destination could be a location in \ncloud storage, an API endpoint, or a database.\nFor push-based systems, the consumer can \ndictate the schema of the data that is being \nreceived, however, a common complexity \nin these systems is synchronization of \nschema definitions between producers and \nconsumers. In these cases, schema registries \ncan come in handy for defining a single source \nof truth for the expected format of data.\nPipelines using a pull methodology have \na slightly different definition of ownership. \nMost notably, the consumer dictates the \ncadence of ingestion. Typically, this happens \non a predefined schedule, though it can also \nbe extended to use an event-driven trigger. \nWe’ll look at how this would work next. \nWith pull based data access patterns, the \nconsumer pulls the data based on the access \npattern of the producer. For example, with a \nREST API, the consumer may have to perform \npagination, and supply query parameters in \na very specific structure. For replication of \ndata in a database, the consumer would be \nresponsible for defining the SQL query for \npulling data, along with the logic for \nincremental loads. Note that tools like dlt \nand Sling support this behavior out-of-the-box.\nAn example pipeline that follows the push \naccess pattern may look like this:\nA process for the producer starts at a \nscheduled time or preset interval\nT he producer performs some form of \nprocessing or creation of data\nT he producer pushes their datasets to \na storage location like S3, GCS, or an \nSFTP Server\nT he consumer ingests that new \ndataset on their own schedule\n01\n02\n03\n04\nAn example pipeline that follows the pull \naccess pattern may look like this:\nThe process starts at a scheduled \ntime or preset interval\nC onsumer job fetches new data \navailable\nC onsumer processes new data \nas needed for integration into the \nplatform\n01\n02\n03\n03 | Design Patterns\nPush\nPull\nDesign Patterns for Data Pipelines\n--- Page 22 ---\n22\n03 | Design Patterns\nDesign Patterns for Data Pipelines\nThe final flavor of the pipeline uses a polling \nparadigm. It can look similar to the pull pattern, \nbut this implementation typically pairs well \nwith event-driven architectures. It requires \nthe consumer to maintain the state in ways \nnot necessarily needed with other designs.\nPolling implementations transfer the cadence \nof ingestion to the consumer. Maintaining a \nstateful pipeline - one knowledgeable of what \ndata it has processed - is critical! Without \nthat knowledge, subsequent runs of the \npipeline may result in duplicate processing \nor unexpected downstream changes.\nHere is a typical poll-based pipeline trigger \nthrough an external webhook:\nMessages are frequently being \npublished to a Kafka message broker\nT he consumer polls this message \nbroker, and processes the records\nI t keeps an identifier or “cursor” of the \nrecord that has most recently been \ncollected\nT he consumer then polls again, at a \nregular interval, providing the “cursor” \nto only retrieve new records\n01\n02\n03\n04\nPoll\n--- Page 23 ---\n23\nMany of the design patterns that were \ndiscussed above benefit from following an \nidempotent design. Idempotency is the idea \nthat an operation, for example a pipeline, \nproduces the same output each time the \nsame set of parameters are provided. This is \noften a great practice in designing data \npipelines as it creates consistency in \nprocessing jobs, but it is especially important \nfor the poll based data access pattern.\nDeterministic systems in software \nengineering is the expectation that the \noutput of a function is only based on its \ninputs. There are no hidden state changes as \na result of calling that function. \nFor example let’s look at two snippets of \nPython code, one which is idempotent, and \nthe other that is not.\nIn this example, the non_deterministic_\nfunction is taking a location and destination \nparameter, and writing the current \ntemperature to a file. Each time this function \nis called, the output will be different, as it \nrelies on an always changing metric being \nreturned from the MyWeatherService.\nNow, let’s compare that to something that \nis idempotent.\nIdempotency\n03 | Design Patterns\nPython\nPython\ndef  current_temperature(location:  str ) -> int :\n return  MyWeatherService().get_current_temperature(location)\ndef  non_idempotent_function(location: str , destination:  str ) ->  None :\n with open (destination,  ‘w’ ) as  f:\n  f.write(current_temperature(location))\ndef  get_temperature(timestamp:  str , location:  str ) ->  int :\n return  MyWeatherService().get_temperature(location, timestamp)\ndef  idempotent_function(timestamp:  str , location:  str , destination:  str ) ->  None :\n with open (destination,  ‘w’ )  as  f:\n  f.write(get_temperature(timestamp, location))\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nIdempotent\nNot Idempotent\n--- Page 24 ---\n24\nThis example differs in that our idempotent_\nfunction requires a timestamp parameter. So \ninstead of getting the temperature at a given \nlocation at the time the function is called, \nwe are responsible for explicitly providing \nthe time, and each time this function is \ncalled with that specific timestamp, it should \nreturn the same value.\nPractically, you want your pipelines to produce \nthe same result given the same context. \nMaking this happen - or failing to do so - \nis often at the root of pipeline complexity. \nThe means of doing this can be relatively \nsimple. At its most basic, this may mean \nrecording IDs, filenames, or anything that \nuniquely identifies your input data that has \nalready been processed by the data pipeline. \nThis can often be done by leveraging the \ncontext of an orchestrator, for example, the \ntrigger time of a pipeline, or the categorical \npartition data that can be used as a \nparameter to your processing code.\nFor instance, when running a batch pipeline \ndaily, each execution would not look at the \nlast 24 hours of data. Instead, it would use a \nspecific 24-hour period between two \nspecific “bookends.” \nBy using an explicit window of time rather \nthan something relative to the execution of \nthe job, you remove one potential cause of \npipeline drift. Even the best orchestrators \ncan be resource-constrained. Also, reducing \nyour exposure to slightly delayed jobs is a \nsmall but essential implementation detail as \nyour platform grows. \n03 | Design Patterns\nIdempotency\nPython\n@asset(\n    partitions_def=DailyPartitionsDefinition(start_date=» 2024-10-01 »)\n)\ndef  daily_partitioned_events(context: AssetExecutionContext)\n    «»» Each execution of this asset is configured to be tied to a specific\n    day, thanks to the DailyPartitionsDefinition.

Both topics are \nincredibly vast - and beyond the \nscope of this chapter. But whether \nyou are implementing a Data \nLakehouse, Data Lake, or Data \nWarehouse as the central data store \nfor your platform, you will find many \nsimilarities in their structures. \n26\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n27\nY ou’ve probably heard of the Medallion \nArchitecture. While the term may be most \ncommonly associated with Data Lakehouse \narchitectures, the core concepts are essentially \nthe same as those commonly found in Data \nWarehouses that follow an EL T design. \nA Medallion Architecture’s fundamental \nconcept is to ensure data isolation at \nspecific points in its lifecycle. You’ll often \nhear the terms “bronze”, “silver” and “gold” \nused to describe this lifecycle. \nIn a data warehouse context, you may see \n“staged”, “core” and “data mart”. Some \nothers use “raw”, “transformed”, and \n“production”. Regardless of the terminology \nused, the buckets have semantic and \nfunctional significance.\nConsumers typically want clean, well-\nstructured data. This may not be the case \nwhen working with LLMs or other flavors of \nML models, but business use cases always \nexpect clean and structured data.\nA Medallion Architecture makes this \nrelatively easy to manage and understand. \nThis general pattern is very good at reducing \nthe downstream impact of reporting through \nseparation of data ingestion, cleaning, and \nconsumer-ready datasets; it also pairs \nwith data governance and data security. \nCompartmentalization is a core concept.\nLakehouse architectures typically apply this \nstructure to files stored in cloud storage \nservices like S3 or GCS. But, this structure \nis not always necessary, and can be overly \ncomplex for many businesses. Instead, you \ncan apply these same logical distinctions \nwithin your data warehouse. Companies \nfollowing a Lakehouse architecture often \npush the Gold layer into a data warehouse \nfor easier consumption by BI Tools and \nbusiness users.\nBronze • Raw data is stored as it is \nreceived. Ingested data may be \nschemaless\n• Often called a “Landing Zone”\nSilver • Cleaned and structured datasets \nderived from the Bronze layer\n• Primary validation layer for data \nquality\nGold • Consumer-ready datasets\n• May include pre-processed \naggregates and metrics\n• Consumers may be business \nusers, applications, or other data \nstores\n04 | Data Modeling\n--- Page 28 ---\n28\nWhere the Lakehouse architecture uses \nstructured cloud storage service buckets, \na data warehouse would instead segregate \nthese datasets by schema. \nModern warehouses like BigQuery, \nDatabricks, Snowflake, and Clickhouse \nare blurring the boundaries between Data \nLakehouse and Data Warehouse. Regardless \nof your technology choice, segregating \nyour data based on how well it has been \nvalidated, cleaned, and transformed is \nalways a good decision. \nA bonus of this structure is the separation \nof reads and writes. Though it adds some \noverhead, separating these two operations \nallows for a more stable platform for a few \nreasons. This separation sets the foundation \nfor more complex CI/CD workflows like \nBlue/ Green Deployments. It also enables \nour platform to be resilient to upstream \nchanges. You’ll be hard-pressed to find \na data engineer who has not dealt with \nunexpected source data changes or has \nnot had to combine “legacy” and “modern” \ndatasets into one table. Doing so without \nseparating reading data and writing data is \nvery difficult.\nHopefully, it will seem obvious that raw \ndata can be captured in one place and \nmaterialized as clean data elsewhere. This \nsingle design decision will save you many \nhours of future headaches. Remember, your \ncurrent data architecture has a finite lifespan \nand will evolve. You also should expect \nyour input data to change over time. This is \nespecially true when consuming data from \na transactional database. Isolating raw data \nallows you to abstract away the processing \nneeded for handling miscellaneous edge \ncases or combining legacy datasets with \ntheir current versions. You cannot always \nrely on upstream systems to provide \nconsistent input data; instead, you should \ndesign your data platform to accommodate \nthese inevitable changes. \n04 | Data Modeling\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n29\nA well-configured platform makes building a \ncomposable and extensible data platform \neasier, but what constitutes “well-configured”? \nRegardless of your data platform’s stage of \nmaturity, you should be designing a system \nthat addresses specific use cases for your \nteam. This will require supporting common \nfunctionality typically found within mature \nsoftware products. Some of that functionality \nmay be bespoke, some from OSS tools, and \nsome from paid vendor tooling. \nWell-configured platforms avoid vendor \nlock-in. To a lesser degree, they may also \navoid “tooling” lock-in. In the extreme case, \nthey may even limit your dependency on any \nsingle tool in the entire system.\nAvoiding lock-in applies to paid software \nsolutions and open-source tooling choices. \nThere are plenty of “modern” data tools, and \nevery tool category has many options. \nMaintaining your ability to change data \npipeline vendors, transformation tooling, or \nreporting and metrics layers provides a \nreasonable level of “future-proofing” without \nrequiring a large upfront investment. \nSo, what components should we consider \nwhen designing our future-proofed data \nplatform?\nAt a high level, your data platform is likely to incorporate tooling for the \nfollowing components:\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\nDesigning a Well-Configured \nPlatform\n04 | Data Modeling\nOrchestration Ingestion\nData Cataloging Transformation\nStorage Observability\nReplication Data Versioning\n--- Page 30 ---\n30\nYou might find that a single tool covers \nmore than one of these categories. But you \ncan certainly find specialized tools for each \ncomponent as well. \nAdditionally, as platforms evolve, you may \nfind that multiple solutions are required for \nany given category. For example, you may \nrequire storage in multiple cloud providers, \nOrchestrators vary greatly, but they all allow you to automatically execute a series \nof steps and track the results. Typically, they coordinate the inputs and outputs of \nyour platform.\nPopular \nChoices:\nObservation and tagging of your data is crucial so that stakeholders and analysts can \nbetter understand the data that they use day-to-day.

By themselves, they are \nspecialized technology choices that may \nnot fit well within your organization. But, \nwhen combined into a data platform, they \nform a mutually exclusive and collectively \nexhaustive set of features that provide a \nstrong foundation for platform development. \nThe key to going from just a collection of \ntools to an effective platform is incorporating \nthese tools within well-understood design \npatterns and architectures. And that topic is \ncoming up shortly.\n04 | Data Modeling\nDesigning a Well-Configured Platform\nWhen working in different environments, or as your data evolves, it can be nice to \nmaintain a history of the changes being made. Data versioning tools can provide a \nlayer on top of your data storage to enable this functionality.\nPopular \nChoices:\nData Versioning08\n--- Page 34 ---\n34\nThese features can drastically improve the \nreliability of your data platform, for example, \nsome upstream data producers or teams \ncan be unpredictable, or, outages can occur \nfor services or compute environments. \nWithout having these common features, the \ntrust in your data and data platform can be \nsignificantly tarnished. \nRestarting failed pipelines and services, \ninspecting logs, and backfilling datasets are \ncommon, repeated tasks familiar to every \ndata engineer. Before you jump into designing \nhow you’ll process your data inputs, you \nneed to address these fundamental pieces. \nOften these fall under the purview of your \norchestrator, but not always. \nThere are many ways to design a data platform, \nand many pieces that make up that whole. And, \nthough there are plenty of tools available, some \nfeatures should be considered standard. \nThese quality of life features that should be \nrequired within all data systems, and are often \nthe differentiator between a robust data \nplatform from a collection of one-off scripts:\nThese tools help you support the evolution of \nyour technology stack without compromising \nthe standard of software your team expects. \nYou would seldom release an application to \nproduction without runtime logging or observability \ntooling. Data platforms are no different.\nIt should be clear by this point that there are \nmany parts that make the “whole” of a data \nplatform. Whether tools, pipeline design or \ngeneral data architectures, there is no \nshortage of options or decisions to make. \nBut don’t get confused - many of the tools \nand topics we covered in this book \ncomplement one another. The data pipeline \ndesigns we covered are not mutually exclusive, \nand can be used alongside one another. \nMost of these patterns are just specific \nnames for familiar and common activities \nfound in countless software applications. \nDesigning an effective data platform from \nscratch can be challenging, and there are many \ncontradictory examples online. But rather \nthan focusing on tool selection and losing \nthe forest for the trees, it’s critical that you \nrecognize the components of your data \nplatform are tools to solve various problems. \nOften, teams in and across organizations are \nsolving very similar problems. While the domains \nand datasets may be different, there is a common \npattern to the architectures and design principles \nthat are used to build a robust data platform.\n04 | Data Modeling\nMust have features\nLogging\nRetries\nBackfilling\nSelf-healing pipelines\n\n--- Page 35 ---\n05\nData \nQuality\n--- Page 36 ---\n36\nHaving a framework defined for how to enforce data \nquality, along with a set of standards for what is considered \nacceptable is a crucial step in building a data platform \nthat an organization can trust. Defining these standards \noften originates from the governance team. However, it is \noften a cross-organization and multi-team collaboration \nfor well-defined data quality standards. Many rules come \nfrom the stakeholders who have expertise in the underlying \ndata and reporting needs, but it is often common for \nthese stakeholders too to not have a full understanding \nof the origin of their data. This is why it’s important for the \ndefinitions of data quality to be a result of a team effort.\nData is used to both run and improve \nthe ways that the organization \nachieves their business objectives \n… [data quality ensures that] data \nis of sufficient quality to meet the \nbusiness needs.\nD avid Loshin\nThe Practitioner’s Guide to Data Quality Improvement\nA core component of data platforms is data quality, or \nmore appropriately, a framework for enforcing data quality \nstandards on the data produced by the pipelines in the data \nplatform. This is because data quality metrics are indicators \nthat are used to determine if data is suitable for use in \ndecision-making.\n36\n\n--- Page 37 ---\n37\nThere exist 6-commonly defined \ndimensions for defining rules of data quality. \nThese include: timeliness, completeness, \naccuracy, validity, uniqueness \nand  consistency.\nTimeliness refers to how up-to-date data \nis. If data is being produced by an upstream \nsystem every hour, and the downstream \nmodels haven’t been updated in the past \nweek, then this report is not timely. On the \ncontrary, if you have data being produced \nhourly, and the replication and modeling of \nthat data triggering just after it is produced, \nthen that is a timely pipeline.\ndate_week_end date_report_received status\n2025-01-01 2025-01-01 ON_TIME\n2025-01-08 2025-01-08 ON_TIME\n2025-01-15 2025-01-15 ON_TIME\n2025-01-22 NULL MISSING\n2025-01-29 NULL MISSING\nExample:  An organization expects a \nfinancial report to land in an S3 bucket on \na weekly basis, however, this report hasn’t \nbeen received for the past month\nImpact:  Data not received within the \nexpected latency window can result in \noperational impacts and inaccuracies in \nanalysis and reporting\nThe Dimensions of Data \nTimeliness\nThese dimensions can be referenced \nin defining rules of data quality and \nimplementing quality checks.\n05 | Data Quality\n\n--- Page 38 ---\nNo required field should be missing for a record \nof data, whether that be a column in a database \ntable, or an attribute of new-line delimited \nJSON.

However, \nthe enforcement of rules should remain \nconsistent across tools.\nA non-exhaustive list of tools that we’ve found \nto be prevalent in data platforms includes:\nData quality testing for \nSQL-, Spark-, and Pandas-\naccessible data\nGeneral purpose data \nvalidation tool with built-in \nrulesets\nLibrary built on top of Apache \nSpark for defining “unit tests \nfor data”, which measure data \nquality in large datasets\nAssertions you make about \nyour models and other \nresources in your dbt project\nAsset checks\nA benefit of tools like Soda and Great \nExpectations is that they provide a large set \nof rules out-of-the-box. Instead of having to \nwrite custom logic for validating the 6 data \ndimensions that were previously mentioned, \nit is possible to apply the logic of already \nexisting rules.\nUltimately, it’s important to choose the data \nquality framework that is most appropriate \nfor the other tools in your data platform, \nand it is perfectly acceptable to compose \nmultiple tools that suit your needs. But it’s \nimportant to design your platform in such \na way that you have a central observation \nlayer over these disparate tools and \nframeworks, likely done at the orchestrator, \nso that the stakeholders can have a strong \nunderstanding and confidence in their data.\nTools and Technologies\n05 | Data Quality\n\n--- Page 42 ---\n42\nIt should be noted that the enforcement of \ndata quality should occur throughout all \nstages of the data lifecycle. This includes \nthe application layer, data replication, the \nanalytical layer, and reporting.\nTo provide an example, imagine you are a \nSaaS company that maintains a list of their \nusers. The e-mail address that is provided by \nthe user should be verified at the application \nlayer, both the client side and server side.\nWhen this data is replicated in an analytical \nwarehouse, validation should also occur to \nensure that the data that is present in the \nwarehouse matches what exists in the \nsource database table. It is important to \nensure that the record exists and that no \nduplicate records have been created from \nsome faulty replication logic. Additionally, while \nthe e-mail address should be structured in a \nvalid format for an e-mail address, for \ndefensive data quality enforcement, the \nstructure of the address should also be \nvalidated at the warehouse layer.\nIn the analytical layer, it is common for many \ndownstream models to be produced that \nreference application data, like this user table. \nIt’s important to validate that the \nrepresentation of this user is accurate and \nthat there are no faults in how these models \nare being formed or how this data is being \njoined with other datasets. This can be \nparticularly tricky as data from many \ndatasets come together.\nFinally, these models will likely be surfaced \nin some kind of way, whether that be \nthrough dashboards, some kind of alerting, \nor through reverse-ETL loaded back into the \napplication database. It is important to \nvalidate that the data being surfaced meets \nthe expectations of the business.\nThe full data lifecycle\nEnforcement of Data Quality\n05 | Data Quality\n\n--- Page 43 ---\n43\nWhen constructing a data platform, having \na central control plane, like an orchestrator, \nmakes it much easier to enforce data quality \nstandards at a high level and throughout all \nstages of the data lifecycle.\nThere are several benefits to this approach, \none being that the data platform owner \ncan act as the overseer to the standards. \nIf the organization has a number of teams, \neach with its own set of rules, these can \nbe consolidated into a single playbook for \nenforcing standards by the data platform \nowner through the orchestrator.\nAdditionally, the orchestrator is responsible \nfor determining which jobs should run, if any \ndata quality issues arise, it has control over \nthe downstream jobs that may surface data \nto a dashboard or application. By having full \nvisibility into the quality of data at the various \npoints of its life in the orchestrator, reporting \nof this problematic data can be prevented.\nFinally, the orchestrator is also home to \nsystem-wide alerting, along with updating \nof data in data catalogs. The orchestrator \ncan keep the engineers and platform owners \ninformed of problematic data in a standard \nway for on-call duties.\n05 | Data Quality\nEnforcement of Data Quality\nA central control plane \n(orchestrator)\n--- Page 44 ---\nExample \nData \nPlatforms\n06\n--- Page 45 ---\n45\nTo better understand how one \nmight architect a data platform, \nlet’s walk through several example \ndata platform stacks.

It is very fast to get started.\nSource Data Postgres\nWarehouse Snowflake\nOrchestrator Dagster\nIngestion Fivetran, dlt, Sling\nTransformation Framework SDF\nReporting Looker, Hex\nMDS \nby the Book\n06 | Example Data Platforms\n\n--- Page 50 ---\n50\nSource Data Postgres, s3\nWarehouse -\nOrchestrator A WS Step Functions\nIngestion A WS Glue\nTransformation Framework Spark, Athena\nReporting Looker\nIf you are dealing with extremely large data \nsets, you may be interested in foregoing \na traditional data warehouse in favor of a \ncompute engine like Spark. This company \nprocessed many millions of events on a daily \nbasis and relied heavily on Spark for large-\nscale computation\nIn lieu of a warehouse, data in s3 was \nindexed by A WS Glue, transformed with A WS \nEMR (Spark), and consumed downstream \nthrough Athena. \nThis architecture is not complicated but it is \na significant deviation from the data stacks \nrelying on cloud warehouses for storage and \ncomputing. \nData \nLakehouse\n06 | Example Data Platforms\n\n--- Page 51 ---\n51\nSource Data SFTP , s3\nWarehouse BigQuery\nOrchestrator -\nIngestion A WS Lambda, A WS Fargate\nTransformation Framework dbt\nReporting Omni\nEvent-driven design does not necessarily \nneed an orchestrator; the events themselves \n“orchestrate” the execution of the pipeline. \nIn this company’s case, files landed in SFTP \nand were eventually copied to s3. \ns3 provides native functionality to trigger \nA WS Lambda functions when new files \narrive. As an alternative, long-running \nprocesses were also executed via A WS \nFargate when the A WS Lambda runtimes \nlimits were not sufficient.\nThese files were ingested into BigQuery \nand ultimately transformed with dbt. End \nusers consumed the data through Omni \ndashboards. \nEvent-driven architectures are a way to \nprocess data in a near-real-time fashion, but \nthey have their downsides. Re-execution of \nthe pipeline can be tedious and missed or \ndropped events may go unnoticed without \nsufficient checks in place. \nThe key consideration is that most of these \ncomponents are run within a Docker container.\nEvent Driven\n06 | Example Data Platforms\n\n--- Page 52 ---\n52\nThat concludes the first edition of \nFundamentals of Data Platforms. We’ve \ncovered many topics from an introduction to \nwhat a data platform is, common architecture \nand design patterns, important concepts like \ndata quality, and we even dove into some \nexamples of tools and architectures.\nThe data ecosystem is broad, but hopefully \nthis introduction gives you the information \nthat you need to get started in designing \nand building a data platform for either your \norganizations, or even if you’re just tinkering \nwith a side project.\nAlso keep in mind that tools in the data \necosystem are always evolving, but don’t \nfret, as many of the core architectures and \ndesign patterns covered in this book have \nstood the test of time.\nThank you for taking the time to read \nFundamentals of Data Platforms, and we \nhope you learned something new.\nColton Padden\nC olton is a data engineer, and developer \nadvocate with experience building data platforms \nat fortune 500 institutions, government \nagencies, and startups.

Enfermedades de vías altas.  \n1.1 Enfermedades nasales.  \nLas enfermedades nasales o rinitis pueden son comunes en el perro y el gato y se asocian a \nestornudos, secreción nasal y disnea inspiratoria. \nLa historia clínica, los signos clínicos y el examen físico nos ayudan a definir y localizar la \npatología de vías respiratorias altas. La presencia de estornudos y secreción nasal suele \nasociarse con enfermedades nasales, de senos paranasales y de la nasofaringe. Aún así \ndebemos tener en cuenta que la presencia de secreción nasal no sólo se debe a enfermedades \nnasales sino que también puede ser debido a alteraciones fuera de la cavidad nasal. En casos \nde rinitis crónica a menudo predomina la secreción nasal sobre los estornudos. La presencia de \nestornudos revertidos nos localiza el problema en la zona nasal caudal o nasofaringe. Las \nprincipales enfermedades asociadas a rinitis crónica en perros y gatos son neoplasias nasales, \nrinitis limfoplasmocitaria idiopática y rinitis fúngica.  \nLas causas de secreción nasal y respiración nasal obstructiva se describen en la Tabla 1.  \nLas analíticas generales (hemograma, bioquímica, urianálisis), pruebas de coagulación, presión \narterial y radiografías torácicas son importantes para descartar enfermedades sistémicas o \nextranasales. Las serologías de Aspergillus spp. y Criptococcus spp. son útiles, pero debemos \ntener en cuenta que podemos obtener resultados falsos negativos.  \nEn la mayoría de los casos con rinitis es necesario realizar una exploración bajo anestesia para \nevaluar las estructuras intraorales y comprobar si existen fistulas oronasales, deformaciones \ndel paladar blando, entre otras alteraciones. El siguiente paso es realizar pruebas de imagen \n(radiografías, TAC o RMI si es necesario). Se recomienda realizar las pruebas de imagen \npreviamente a la rinoscopia debido al riesgo de hemorragia y que nos opacifique la imagen. \n El TAC y la RM ofrecen una visualización completa de la cavidad nasal y los senos, esencial \npara visualizar lesiones nasofaríngeas. Cada vez más se incluye el TAC en el protocolo \ndiagnóstico de rinitis crónica, ofrece mucha información, es rápido y el único inconveniente es \nel coste.  \nNormalmente con la imagen de TAC se puede diferenciar entre neoplasia, rinitis fúngica o \ninflamatoria (figura 1). El último paso debe ser la rinoscopia y la toma biopsias de la mucosa \nnasal.  \n\n--- Page 2 ---\n \nFigura 1: Colmillo impactado en la cavidad nasal de un gato.

En gatos las enfermedades nasofaríngeas \nmás comunes son provocadas por granulomas fúngicos, pólipos, neoplasias, estenosis, y  \ncuerpos extraños. En perros observamos podemos observar procesos inflamatorios de la \nnasofaringe, neoplasias, cuerpos extraños y alteraciones congénitas. Menos comúnmente, \npero en perros también podemos observar estenosis nasofaríngea en razas miniturizadas \n(chihuahua y otras razas toy), debido a la selección por rasgos anatómicos, y que sufren de \nsignos obstructivos de vías altas. \nIndependientemente de la causa la sintomatología es parecida (signos de obstrucción de vías \naéreas superiores, esfuerzo inspiratorio, estertores y ronquidos). Los perros respiran por la \nboca (aunque no es la situación ideal) y pueden disminuir los signos asociados a alteraciones \nnasofaríngeas. En cambio, los gatos que no respiran por la boca presentan una sintomatología \nmás marcada. Una inflamación de la NF puede provocar disfagia, tos, aerofagia, cambios en la \nfonación. El síndrome de Horner es común en gatos con afectación de la bulla timpánica \n(Figura 1).  \nLa velocidad de aparición de los signos clínicos y la gravedad es variable en función de la causa. \nUn inicio súbito de la sintomatología sugiere la presencia de un cuerpo extraño mientras que \nuna aparición gradual de estertores y respiración con la boca abierta sugiere la presencia de \nuna masa de crecimiento lento.  \n \nFigura 1: Inclinación de la cabeza en un gato con un pólipo en el oído medio. \nEl examen físico es muy importante en las enfermedades nasofaringeas. Ante un paciente \ncon sintomatología compatible con alteraciones en la nasofaringe, debemos explorar de forma \ncuidadosa el color de las mucosas y la cavidad oral. En pacientes tranquilos debemos palpar el \npaladar blando para determinar si existen masas. Un aumento de los linfonodos mandibulares \npuede observarse en pacientes con tumores nasofaringeos.  \nLa radiografía simple nos puede ayudar a evaluar la nasofaringe ya que la presencia de aire \nen la zona dorsal al paladar blando delimita esta area. En el estudio radiologico podemos \nobservar lesiones, masas que ocupan la NF, pero debido a la dificultad de la zona puede ser \nmuy compleja la interpretación de la imagen. La TC nos define de forma más precisa la \nanatomia de la zona (Figura 2 y 3).  \n\n--- Page 4 ---\n \nFigura 2:  Imagen en TC de un gato con un pólipo nasofaríngeo (Imagen cedida por Rosa \nNovellas) \n \nFigura 3:  Imagen de TC de un gato con estenosis nasofaríngea (Imagen cedida por Rosa \nNovellas) \n \nPor otro lado la exploración directa de la NF bajo anestesia, nos permite retraer el paladar \nblando para evaluar esa zona. Es importante asegurar que el tubo endotraqueal esté bien \n\n--- Page 5 ---\ncolocado. Por otro lado un endoscopio flexible introducido en la faringe y flexionado por \nencima del paladar blando nos puede mostrar las alteraciones presentes en esa zona.   \nCuando se observa una masa en la NF podemos realizar un masaje vigoroso de la zona a \ntraves del paladar blando o bien realizar un lavado nasal anterogrado. Los lavados nasales nos \npermiten efectuar un diagnóstico a la vez que un tratamiento. Debemos asegurarnos que la \nlaringe no es permeable colocando gasas a ambos lados del tubo endotraqueal. Se coloca una \njeringa de 20 mL en la narina y se oculyen las fosas nasales a la vez que ejercemos presión para \nrealizar el lavado. El material retirado mediante el lavado quedará en las gasas colocadas en la \nlaringofaringe. Las ventajas de la técnica del lavado nasal comparado con la endocopia son la \nrapidez, el bajo coste, el uso de material poco específico, mejores muestras para biopsia y los \nbeneficios de la eliminación de la obstrucción.  \nEl estudio citologico de la impromta de las masas NF se correlaciona favorablemente con el \nestudio histologico de éstas, por este motivo es recomendable evaluar las citologias para \nobtener una aproximación diagnóstica más rápida.  \nCuando la extracción de lesiones, como los pólipos inflamatorios, los granulomas o cuerpos \nextraños, no es posible mediante el lavado nasal o la retracción del paladar blando se requiere \nun mejor acceso mediante rinotomía o bien incisión del paladar blando.  \n1.3 Síndrome obstructivo de vías altas del braquiocefálico (SOVAB) \nLa reducción craneofacial a menos de una tercera parte de su tamaño natural tiene inevitablemente \nconsecuencias importantes en las estructuras contenidas en su interior (Foto A). Originalmente se \nobservó que la causa más frecuente de dificultad respiratoria, en el SOVAB, era triple: la estenosis de \nlas narinas, el alargamiento del paladar blando y la eversión de los sáculos laríngeos. Aún así, existen \notras anormalidades de las VAS en estas razas (eversión de las tonsilas, hipoplasia traqueal, Foto B). \nEn el interior de la cavidad nasal, estas estructuras son principalmente los cornetes nasales y las \nfosas nasales. Los cornetes nasales tienen funciones respiratorias en la parte craneal e intermedia de \nla cavidad nasal, así como funciones olfativas en la parte caudal. Se ha descrito, en perros y gatos \nbraquiocefálicos, la presencia de cornetes protruyendo desde las coanas hacia la nasofaringe \ndenominados cornetes aberrantes caudales (CAC), y cornetes que obstruyen la parte craneal e \nintermedia de la cavidad nasal denominados cornetes aberrantes rostrales (CAR).  \n \n \n \nFoto A: Resonancia magnética de un perro normal y un perro braquiocefálico \n \nUna radiografía torácica lateral puede predecir la extensión del paladar largo y permite la medición \ndel diámetro traqueal.  \n\n--- Page 6 ---\n \n      \n \nFoto B: Ratio DT/DET para definir si existe hipoplasia traqueal.  \n \nHarvey y Fink  (1982) idearon una medición que correlaciona el diámetro traqueal con el tamaño \ncorporal. Esta medición se basa en el cálculo de la ratio  entre el diámetro traqueal interno (DTI) \nrespecto a la distancia entre el borde ventral de la primera vértebra torácica y el borde dorsal del \nmanubrio (Diámetro de entrada del tórax; DET). El valor considerado normal de la ratio DT / DTx en \nBulldogs es de 0.127, para perros braquiocefálicos no Bulldogs es de 0.16 y para perros no \nbraquiocefálicos es de 0.2. \nLos síntomas del SOVAB pueden tratarse de forma conservadora con la administración de \ncorticoides, oxígeno, reposo, evitando el calor y la obesidad. Aún así, los tratamientos conservadores \nson meramente paliativos y en la mayoría de los casos  es recomendable realizar un tratamiento \nquirúrgico.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n--- Page 7 ---\n2. Enfermedades de vías bajas  \nLas enfermedades respiratorias de vías bajas, parénquima pulmonar o pleura pueden \nmanifestarse con tos, cianosis, disnea o síncopes. Cuando la respiración va acompañada de \nmovimientos abdominales bruscos la principal sospecha es una efusión pleural o masas \nintratorácicas. En cambio, si la disnea se caracteriza por expiraciones largas probablemente el \nproblema se localiza en bronquios o bronquiolos.  \nEn perros las enfermedades de vías respiratorias bajas más frecuentes son: colapso de \ntráquea, la traqueo -bronquitis infecciosa y la bronquitis crónica. En gatos la enfermedad de \nvías respiratorias bajas más frecuente es el síndrome de asma felino. Las enfermedades de \nparénquima pulmonar que debemos tener en cuenta tanto en perros como en gatos son las \nneumonías bacterianas, parásitos pulmonares, tumores pulmonares, fibrosis pulmonar, edema \npulmonar y el síndrome de distrés respiratorio agudo. A menudo existe una afectación \nconjunta de las vías respiratorias bajas (VB) y del parénquima pulmonar (PP), entonces \nhablamos de bronconeumonías (p.ej: parásitos pulmonares) (Figura 1, 2 y 3).  \n \nFigura 1:  Radiografía dorsoventral y laterolateral de una perra cruzada de 11 años que se \npresenta con disnea aguda y tos. En el examen físico se detecta un soplo izquierdo V/VI y \nhistoria de tumores de mama. En este caso la paciente presenta metástasis múltiples, \nseguramente debido al tumor de mama anterior. Aún así, la clínica de esta paciente se debe al \nedema pulmonar secundario a la endocardiosi mitral (obsérvese el patrón alveolar en el lóbulo \ncaudal derecho y zona hiliar) \n \n\n--- Page 8 ---\nFigura 2:  Radiografía dorsoventral y laterolateral de un perro cruzado de 10 años con tos y \nhemoptisis. Se observa una masa circunscrita en la zona caudo -dorsal pulmonar. En el \ndiagnóstico diferencial incluimos (absceso pulmonar, tumor pulmonar primario, torsión de \nlóbulo, entre otras). Realizamos una lobectomía y se confirma la presencia de un \nadenocarcinoma pulmonar primario. Al año del tratamiento con quimioterapia el paciente \nsigue evolucionando favorablemente.  \n \nFigura 3: Radiografía dorsoventral y laterolateral de un perro de 5 años ingresado en la unidad \nde críticos por una pancreatitis. De forma aguda el paciente muestra disnea. En el diagnóstico \ndiferencial se incluye: edema cardiogénico, edema por hipervolemia iatrogenia, \ntromboembolismo pulmonar, neumonía por aspiración, hemorragia. Debido al cuadro clínico, \nel resultado de las pruebas de coagulación y la ecocardiografía, la principal sospecha es un \nsíndrome de distrés respiratorio agudo (permeabilidad vascular secundaria a enfermedades \nsistémicas) \nCuando sospechamos que un paciente padece sintomatología respiratoria de VB o PP debemos \nrealizar un protocolo diagnóstico completo. En función de la gravedad de la sintomatología \nrealizaremos las pruebas diagnósticas de menos a más invasivas: analítica general, radiografía \ntorácica, coprológicos, serología dirofilaria, ecocardiografía, pruebas coagulación, \nbroncoscopia, lavado broncoalveolar, cultivo y citología del lavado y biopsia pulmonar.  \nRealizar un lavado broncoalveolar puede tener sus riesgos, pero es importante para obtener \nun diagnóstico definitivo. Es importante realizar todas las pruebas no invasivas antes de \nrealizar un lavado broncoalveolar. En un gato con tos podemos sospechar de asma felino e \niniciar un tratamiento con córticos, pero podríamos empeorar su cuadro clínico si este gato \npadece de parásitos pulmonares (Aelurostrongylus abstrusus) (Figura 4).  \nOtro procedimiento diagnóstico es realizar una biopsia pulmonar. Algunas enfermedades \ncomo la fibrosis pulmonar, tumores pulmonares, abscesos o granulomas pulmonares \nrequieren una biopsia para obtener un diagnóstico definitivo. En algunos casos una citología \ndel lóbulo afectado nos puede sugerir que existe una neoplasia o absceso. De todos modos, \ncuando existe una consolidación de un lóbulo normalmente recomendamos realizar una \nlobectomía y posteriormente una biopsia que nos confirmará si se trata de una neoplasia, un \nabsceso, granuloma o una torsión de un lóbulo.  \n2.1 Enfermedad bronquial en el gato  \n \nLa enfermedad bronquial felina engloba todas las patologías inflamatorias y no inflamatorias \ndel árbol bronquial, aun así, las enfermedades bronquiales inflamatorias son las más comunes. \n\n--- Page 9 ---\nLas patologías bronquiales en gatos suelen provocar sintomatología respiratoria, \nprincipalmente tos, silbidos, intolerancia al ejercicio o distrés respiratorio. En gatos la tos no es \nun signo clínico tan común como en el perro. Además, cuando un gato tose, se debe sobre \ntodo a problemas traqueobronquiales, ya que la tos de origen cardíaco es rara en esta especie \n(tabla 1). \n  \nLa enfermedad bronquial inflamatoria felina incluye el asma felino y la bronquitis crónica, se \nconsideran una inflamación de las vías aéreas bajas sin una causa identificable. El Asma Felino \n(AF) se considera una enfermedad bronquial inflamatoria cuyo origen se sospecha \nprincipalmente alérgico. El AF y la bronquitis crónica felina se consideran dos entidades \ndiferentes. El AF afecta de un 1 -5 % de los gatos. Se considera que existe una respuesta \nsecundaria a la exposición de Aero alérgenos mediada por linfocitos T helper 2 que generan \nuna secreción de citoquinas que provocan cambios en las vías aéreas. Las tres características \ncomunes del asma felino son: inflamación de vías aéreas, obstrucción de vías aéreas \n(broncoconstricción) y una respuesta exagerada de las vías aéreas. Los cambios a largo plazo \nde los bronquios generan inflamación y obstrucción crónica. La bronquitis crónica felina (BCF) \nes una patología bronquial muy parecida al asma felino. Su origen se debe a un daño bronquial \ndebido a una infección respiratoria previa o inhalación de irritantes provocando con el tiempo \nun daño crónico bronquio-alveolar.  \n \nLa enfermedad bronquial asociada a Dirofilaria (Heartworm associated respiratory disease -\nHARD) se considera uno de los diferenciales de tos en gatos. Se considera que los gatos \npresentan cierta resistencia a la Dirofiliariosis y que, en muy raras ocasiones, existen gusanos \nadultos. El sistema inmunitario del gato ataca las fases larvarias pulmonares (L5) y la muerte \nde estas larvas provoca una inflamación eosinofílica bronco alveolar. HARD puede ocurrir en \ngatos de vida libre o vida interior ya que la transmisión sucede por mosquitos. En gatos no es \ntan importante evaluar la presencia de dirofilaria mediante pruebas de antígeno o \necocardiografía, ya que no suelen presentar adultos. Así, la prueba de elección seria evaluar la \npresencia de anticuerpos contra D. immitis. En zonas endémicas se recomienda el tratamiento \npreventivo. En caso de presencia de HARD se debe tratar con terapia preventiva junto con \nglucocorticoides y doxicilina para controlar la presencia de Wolbachia.  \n \nDefinir que tipo de patología bronquial padecen nuestros pacientes felinos no es una tarea \nsencilla porque existen entidades difíciles de diferenciar como el asma felino, la bronquitis \ncrónica, la fibrosis pulmonar, las neoplasias difusas o la enfermedad bronquial asociada a \nDirofilaria.  \n \nClínicamente las enfermedades bronquiales se manifiestan con tos, intolerancia al ejercicio, \nsilbidos y distrés respiratorio (tabla 1, 2).  \n \nTabla 1: Signos clínicos en gatos con asma felino \nTos \nAumento de esfuerzo respiratorio \nRespiración con boca abierta \nTaquipnea \nVómito \n \nTabla 2: Hallazgos en el examen físico de un gato con asma felino  \nInducción de la tos al palpar la tráquea \nSilbidos espiratorios \nTaquipnea \nEsfuerzo abdominal espiratorio  \n--- Page 10 ---\n \nEl diagnóstico diferencial de un gato con tos, silbidos o distrés respiratorio debe incluir las \nsiguientes enfermedades infecciosas, inflamatorias y tumorales (Tabla 3).  \n \nTabla 3. Diagnóstico diferencial tos: \nPatologías traqueales \nBronconeumonía parasitaria (Aerulostrongylus abstrusus, Troglostrongylus brevior, Capillaria \naerophila, Dirofilaria immitis, Wolbachia)/ Otros parásitos:Toxocara cati \nInfecciones por bacterias /Mycoplasma \nInfecciones por hongos \nInfecciones por protozoos (toxoplasma)  \nInfecciones víricas (PIF, CV, HV) \nBronquitis crónica /Asma felino \nFibrosis pulmonar  \nNeoplasias \n \n \nLo importante en un primer abordaje es iniciar el protocolo diagnóstico para ir descartando \nenfermedades bronquiales. La investigación inicial debe incluir una analítica general, junto a \nevaluación de prueba de antígeno de Felv y anticuerpo contra Fiv, coprológicos seriados y \nestudio radiológico pulmonar  (Figura 1) . Un 20% de los gatos con enfermedad bronquial \npresentan eosinofilia periférica y un 14% pueden presentar hiperglobulinemia.  \n \nEs necesario realizar examen de las heces para descartar la presencia de Aelurostrongylus \nabstrusus (Baermann test) o Toxocara cati  (flotación) entre otros parásitos  (Figura 3).  La \nparasitosis pulmonar es muy común en gatos con tos (Tabla 4). El tipo de vida del gato nos \ndebe inducir a aumentar la sospecha de parasitosis, sobre todo si caza pensaremos en el riesgo \nque padezca A. abstrusus. Independientemente que las pruebas en heces salgan negativas (la \neliminación de larvas es intermitente) debemos considerar un tratamiento con antiparasitarios \npara descartar este posible origen.  \n \n \n \n \nTabla 4: Parásitos que pueden afectar el parénquima pulmonar en gatos  \n \n• Parásitos gastrointestinales con migración pulmonar: \n– Toxocara canis \n– Ancylostoma caninum \n• Parásitos pulmonares \n– Aelurostrongylus abstrusus \n– Capillaria aerophila \n– Trogostrongylus brevior \n– Paragonimus kellicoti  \n• Parásitos cardíacos o arterias pulmonares \n– Dirofilaria immitis \n• Parásitos sistémicos con afectación pulmonar ocasional \n– Toxoplasma gondii \n \nEl estudio radiológico puede mostrar un patrón bronquial generalizado que no permite definir \nel origen de esta lesión. A diferencia de otras patologías bronquiales, en el asma felino, existe \n--- Page 11 ---\nbroncoconstricción reversible que provoca atrapamiento de aire. Esta alteración se observa en \nlas radiografías torácicas debido a que se muestra un pulmón hiperlucente con el diafragma \naplanado y una mayor expansión pulmonar debido a la retención de aire (Figura 1). En casos \ncomo la bronquitis crónica puede existir una cierta broncoconstricción crónica debido a la \nremodelación bronquial y puede mostrar imágenes radiológicas parecidas. Es frecuente \nobservar colapso del lóbulo pulmonar medio derecho debido a acúmulo de moco o atelectasis \nen gatos con asma. La falta de alteraciones radiológicas no descarta la presencia de asma \nfelino u otras patologías bronquiales.  \n \n \nFigura 1: Radiografía lateral derecha torácica en un gato con asma.  \n \nEn una segunda fase de pruebas se pueden incluir las pruebas para descartar una dirofilaria \n(Anticuerpos +/- antígeno de D. immitis), ecocardiografía y ecografía de abdomen.   \n \nEn una tercera fase se plantea realizar las pruebas más invasivas que requieren anestesia: TC \npulmonar, broncoscopia + lavado broncoalveolar (citología + cultivos + PCR micoplasma de la \nsecreción) y último caso lobectomía y biopsia pulmonar. Los gatos presentan un riesgo más \nelevado de realizar broncoscopia y lavado broncoalveolar debido a su respuesta exagerada de \nlas vías aéreas, más aún si el gato está disneico. En esta situación este procedimiento \ndiagnóstico puede implicar un alto riesgo para la vida del paciente.  \n \nLos gatos con AF presentan un infiltrado bronco alveolar con un porcentaje más elevado de \neosinófilos (17%), aun así, ya que en casos crónicos existe daño bronquial pueden presentar un \ninfiltrado también neutrofílico. Debido a que las enfermedades parasitarias pulmonares \npueden provocar eosinofilia en el lavado podrían confundirse con AF. Es importante realizar un \nbuen protocolo diagnóstico previo al lavado bronco alveolar. Aun así, en algunos casos se \npueden observar larvas en el lavado que definirán el diagnóstico de bronquitis parasitaria. En \ngatos con bronquitis crónica a menudo presentan una inflamación neutrofílica. Aun así, no \nexiste un resultado claro entre las patologías bronquiales y el estudio del lavado bronco \nalveolar. Encontrar una inflamación mixta en el lavado bronco -alveolar es común en gatos con \nenfermedad bronquial.  \n \nActualmente existen pruebas más especificas y novedosas ante pacientes felinos con sospecha \nde AF. Se puede realizar una prueba intradérmico de alergia o bien una prueba alergeno -\nespecífica de IgE para buscar la etiología de esta respuesta exagerada a nivel respiratorio y \nevitar el alérgeno o bien iniciar una inmunoterapia alergeno -específica. Por otro lado, existen \nestudios novedosos del uso de la pletismografía y de marcadores (endotelina -1) para \ndiferenciar entre asma felino y otras enfermedades bronquiales.  \n \n\n--- Page 12 ---\nEl tratamiento de los gatos con AF se basa en administrar corticosteroides de forma crónica \njunto con broncodilatadores. Estos tratamientos mejoran la sintomatología de nuestros \npacientes, pero no tratan la patología en sí de la enfermedad. Los corticoides se pueden \nadministrar vía oral mediante prednisolona o bien inhalada utilizando fluticasona o budesónida \n(Figura 2). Ambas opciones reducen la eosinofilia bronquial y reducen la sintomatología.  \n \nFigura 2: Cámara de aerosol para realizar terapia inhalada. \n \nLos broncodilatadores son útiles para reducir la broncoconstricción en ataques agudos de \nasma. La terbutalina inyectable es la mejor opción ante una crisis asmática.  \n \nOtros tratamientos novedosos para AF refractario incluyen el uso de omega 3, lidocaína \ninhalada, inhibidores de la tirosin-quinasa o células madre (Tabla 5).  \n \n \nFigura 3: Larvas de Aelurostrongylus abstrusus en el lavado bronquial de un gato. \nTabla 5: Fármacos más frecuentes usados en el tratamiento del asma felina \nFármaco Clase Dosis Frecuencia Ruta Indicaciones \nPrednisolona corticosteroide 2,5-5 \nmg/gato \n2v/día-c/2-\n3 días \nVO Inflamación crónica \nde la vía aérea \nDexametasona corticosteroide 1 mg/kg Una dosis  IV Manejo de la crisis \naguda \nFluticasona Corticosteroide \nInhalado \n110-220 \nug \nc/2 días –\ndías \nalternos \nInaH Inflamación crónica \nde las VAS \nCiclosporina Inmunosupressor 10 mg/kg c/2 días \n(control \nVO Alternativa a los \nesteroides \n\n--- Page 13 ---\nniveles) \nCiproheptadina Antihistam. \nAnti-serotonina \n2 \nmg/gato \n1v/día-\n2V/día \nVO Interfiere en la \ncontracción de la \nmm lisa \nTerbutalina Agonista beta -\nadrenérgico \n0,01 \nmg/kg en \ncrisis \nRepetir \nc/15-30 min \nIM, \nIV, \nSC \nAlivia la \nbroncoconstricción \n(BC) \nTerbutalina Agonista beta -\nadrenérgico \n0,625 \nmg/gato \n2V/día VO Manejo a largo plazo \nde la BC \nAlbuterol Agonsita beta -\nadrenérgico \n100ug \ncrisis \nRepetir \nc/15-30 min \nInaH Alivia la BC \nAlbuterol Agonista beta -\nadrenérgico \n100ug 2V/día InaH Menejo a largo plazo \nde la BC \nTeofilina acción \nsostenida \nmetilxantina 25mg/kg 1v/día VO Manejo a largo plazo \nde la BC \n \n3.Enfermedades pleurales en el perro y el gato \nLas efusiones pleurales son una causa común de distrés respiratorio en perros y gatos. Se \ntrata de un acúmulo de líquido patológico en el espacio pleural, que según el volumen puede \nsuponer un riesgo para la vida del animal.  \n3.1 Signos clínicos y diagnóstico diferencial de los pacientes con patologías pleurales. \nVarias enfermedades pueden producir un acúmulo de líquido en el espacio pleural y provocar \nun compromiso respiratorio debido a una expansión reducida de los pulmones. La causa \nsubyacente generalmente determina el pronóstico y el tratamiento. El tipo de efusión pleural \nse puede clasificar en diferentes categorias (Tabla1). Después de identificar el tipo de efusion \npodemos establecer un diagnostico diferencial más preciso (Tabla 2) \n \nTabla 1: Caracterización de las efusiones pleurales (valores variables según fuente) \nTipo de fluido Proteinas totales Recuento celular \nTrasudado puro <2,5 mg/dl <1500/ul \nTrasudado \nmodificado \n2,5-7,5 mg/dl 1000-7000/ul \nExudado >3,0 mg/dl >7000/ul \n \nEn perros las causas comunes de efusion pleural incluyen piotorax, efusión pericárdica, masas \nmediastínicas, quilotorax o neoplasia metastática y cardiomiopatía dilatada.  \nEn el gato las principales causas de efusion pleural son piotórax, masas mediastínicas, \nlinfomas, enfermedades cardíacas y peritonitis infecciosa felina (Figura 1).  \n--- Page 14 ---\nLos pacientes con efusiones pleurales a menudo presentan una clinica muy grave, con riesgo \npara su vida. En algunos casos es necesario realizar una toracocentesis de urgéncia antes de \nproseguir con el protocolo diagnóstico. El tipico protocolo incluye hemograma completo, \nbioquímica gneral, urianálisis, pruebas de virus en gatos (Fiv, Felv) y pruebas específicas para \nenfermedades infecciosas.  \n \nA B  \nC D  \nFigura 1:  Radiografía torácica laterolateral de un gato con efusión pleural y pericárdica.

Una vez el paciente \npresente una situación clínica estable realizaremos radiografías de tórax (Figura 2). Además a \nveces podemos diagnosticar la causa primaria de la efusión pleural una vez hemos realizada la \ntoracocentesis. La ecografía torácica y la tomografía computerizada pueden ser útiles para \ndiagnosticar masas en el parénquima pulmonar o el mediastino. Si sopechamos de una \nneoplasia metastatica debemos realizar una ecografía abdominal.  Para descartar una \ncardiomiopatía es necesario realizar una ecocardiografía.  \n--- Page 16 ---\nA B\n \nFigura 2: A) Radiografía torácica latero-lateral de un gato con una moderada efusión pleural.

Puede ser necesaria la administración de \nfluidos, si existe hipotensión, o diuréticos si existe sobrecarga del volumen vascular.  \nPara realizar una toracocentesis ante un paciente con efusión pleural debemos rasurar y \nlimpiar quirúrgicamente la zona donde se realizará la toracocentesis (Figura 3). Necesitamos \ndos jeringuillas grande (10-60 mL), una llave de tres vias, una palometa o agujas más largas, un \nrecipiente colector y tubos para recojer muestras. Algunos pacientes requieren sedación para \nfacilitar el proceso (una combinación de butorfanol 0,1 -0,3 mg/kg IV con diacepam 0,1 -0,3 \nmg/kg IV puede ser suficiente).  \n \nFigura 3: Punción de una efusión pleural en un gato con cardiomiopatía hipertrófica \n\n--- Page 17 ---\nSe recomienda pinchar entre el 7 -8 espacio intercostal cerca de la unión intercostal. Siempre \nrealizar la punción craneal a la costilla para evitar los nervios y vasos sanguineos. Una vez \ndentro de la cavidad torácica, la aguja debe dirijirse caudalmente para evitar laceraciones de \npulmón. Con la excepción de una efusión hemorragica pura, intentaremos eliminar el máximo \nde líquido pleural.  \nComo complicaciones de la toracocentesis debemos considerar un pneumotórax iatrogénico, \nlaceración cardíaca, sangrado, edema pulmonar por reexpansión.  \n3.2. Enfermedades específicas y su tratamiento \n3.2.1 Piotórax \nLa causa de piotórax más frecuente en gatos es secundaria a la mordedura de otros gatos o \ndebido a la contaminación ambiental de heridas punzantes. Otras posibles causas son la rotura \no perforación del esofago, tráquea o bronquios, cuerpos extraños que migran (espigas), \nneumonía bacteriana que produce abscesos pulmonares que pueden perforarse o bien una \ncontaminación iatrogénica a traves de toracocentesis o toracotomías.   \nEn perros las causas descritas de piotórax incluyen heridas penetrantes en el cuello, pecho o \nmediastino, peforaciones esofágicas, parásitos pulmonares, nemonía bacteriana con rotura de \nabscesos, diseminación hematógena desde otros focos sépticos, diseminación desde una \ndiscospondilitis, neoplasia con un absceso secundario o contaminación iatrogénica. Las razas \nde perros cazadores o de trabajo estan sobrerepresentados y la principal causa es la aspiración \nde espigas y su migración a traves del tracto respiratorio.  \nLas bacterias principalmente aisladas en perros con piotórax son los anaerobios: Bacteroides, \nFusobacterium, Peptostreptococcus y Porphyromonas, y los aerobios: Actinomyces, \nPasteurella, E. Coli , Streptococcus. Estas bacterias son las tipicamente aisladas también en \ngatos.  \nUna vez las bacterias contactan con la cavidad pleural, se liberan mediadores de la inflamación \nprovocando un aumento de la permeabilidad del endotelio capilar además de una obstrucción \ndel flujo limfático. Este proceso resulta en un acúmulo de fluido, proteínas y células \ninflamatorias en el espacio pleural.  \nLos signos clínicos de un perro o gato con piotórax aparecen de semanas a meses del incidente \ninicial (inhalación espiga, mordedura, herida, neumonía). A menudo no se detectan las heridas \ncutáneas que iniciaron el proceso, por ese motivo a veces es dificil obtener un diagnóstico \ndefinitivo.  Los signos clínicos típicos de los gatos son disnea restrictiva, depresión, letargia, \nanorexia, dolor y palidez. En perros es común observar intolerancia al ejercicio, respiración \nrestrictiva o panteo, tendencia a mantenerse de pie, anorexia, letargia y tos. En algunos \npacientes podemos observar colapso debido a un shock séptico.  \nEn el examen físico podemos encontrar ruidos cardíacos y pulmonares apagados, fiebre o \nhipotermia, taquicardia, pulso débil y mucosas pálidas.  \nEl análisis del líquido pleural (predominan los neutrófilos con cambios tóxicos o degenerativos \ny la presencia de bacterias) y el cultivo nos permitiran obtener un diagnóstico definitivo.  \nEn las analíticas generales podemos observar neutrofília con desviación a la izquierda, anemia \nno regenerativa, hipoalbuminemia,  y en casos de sépticemia podemos observar hipoglucemia, \nhiperbilirubinemia.  \n--- Page 18 ---\nSe recomienda colocar drenaje para drenal el líquido pleural e iniciar terapia antibiótica segun \ncultivo. Los lavados estan recomendados aunque actualmente existe controversia en si sólo \nusar el tubo de drenaje para eliminar líquido o realizar lavados. En algunos casos se forman \ncavidades con bridas de fibrina que retienen pus y que deben ser eliminadas mediante ciurgía.  \nA B C  \nFigura 4: A) Radiografía torácica latero -lateral de un perro con efusión pleural. \nB)Toracocentesis en un perro con efusión pleural. Se trata de un dogo de 8 años con historia \nde cardiomiopatía dilatada que de forma aguda presenta una disnea restrictiva, tipica de \nefusión pleural. Para mejorar su situación clínica se realiza una punción y se observa qeu el \ntipo de efusión es un exudado séptico. La principal sospecha inicial fue una descompensación \nde su cardiomiopatía, pero el diagnóstico final fue un piotórax secundario a una espiga.  \n \n2.2 Quilotorax \nEl acúmulo de quilo dentro del espacio pleural indica una alteración del drenaje limfático del \nconducto torácico. El quilo es irritante para la superfície pleural, especialmente en el gato, y \nproduce una inflamación secundaria con un engrosamiento de la pleura parietal, visceral y \nmediastínica. El quilo normalmente se drena en el sistema venoso a través del conducto \ntorácico. En los perros el sistema del conducto torácico se situa en el lado derecho del \nmediastino dorsal a la aorta y drena a las venas braquiocefálicas en la vena cava craneal. En el \ngato el sistema torácico es un conducto único localizado en el lado izquierdo del mediastino y \ntermina en la vena yugular externa izquierda.  \nHoy en día el quilotórax sigue siendo una enfermedad enigmatica debido a la dificultad para \nencontrar una causa específica y poder definir un tratamiento efectivo.  \nEn la mayoría de perros y gatos el quilotórax se produce debido a una dilatación de los vasos \nlimphaticos (linfangiectasia) y una pérdida de linfa des del conducto torácico.  Cualquier causa \nque provoque un aumento en la presión de la vena cava craneal tiene el potencial de generar \nun quilotórax.  En el diagnóstico diferencial de quilotórax debemos incluir neoplasias (que \nobstruyan el conducto torácico), enfermedades cardíacas (tumores de base del corazón, \nenfermedades congénitas, cardiomiopatías-especialmente en gatos), traumatismo, torsión de \nlóbulo pulmonar, tumores mediastínicos, dirofilaria, trombosis de la vena cava craneal e \nidiopático. También podemos encontrar quilotórax en perros y gatos que también sufren de \nlinfangiectasia intestinal o quiloabdomen.  \nUltimamente las enfermedades pericárdicas han tomado importancia en referencia al \nquilotórax. La restricción del atrio y ventriculo derecho secundaria a una efusión pericárdica \npuede aumentar la presión de la vena cava craneal y puede contribuir al desarrollo de un \nquilotórax (Figura 6).  \n\n--- Page 19 ---\n \nA B  \nC D  \nFigura 6: A) Radiografía latero -lateral de un perro con efusión pericárdica. B) Ecocardiografía \ndel mismo paciente, no se observa ningún tumor evidente. Se trata de un Golden Retriever de \n11 años con efusión pericárdica recidivante que se sometió a una pericardiectomía para \nobtener biopsias y paliar la sintomatoloía. Se diagnosticó un mesotelima maligno que se \ndiseminó a nivel pleural y el paciente empezó a generar quilotórax 1 mes después de la \nintervención (C y D).  \nExisten casos determinados como idiopáticos cuando no se encuentra ninguna causa \npredisponente.  \nLos signos clínicos y el examen físico son similares a otras causas de efusión pleural.  Para \ndefinir el diagnóstico es necesario realizar una toracocentesis y un análisis del líquido (Figura \n7). La densidad típica del quilo es de 1022 a 1027 en perros y de 1019 a 1050 en gatos. La \nconcentración de proteína va de 2,5 -6,2 g/dl en perros y de 2,6 -10 g/dl en gatos. El recuento \nde células normalmente es menor a 10.000 leucocitos en ambas especies. Aunque la célula \npredominante es el linfocito pequeño, existe un a inflamación secundaria que  genera una \nreacción neutrofílica marcada. Para definir exactamente si se trata de un quilotórax debemos \nobservar un nivel de trigliceridos superior en la efusión pleural que en sangre.  \n\n--- Page 20 ---\n \nFigura 7 : Toracocentesis de un gato con quilotórax.  \nEl tratamiento de un quilotórax consiste en determinar su origen y una vez solucionada la \ncausa inicial el quilotórax se reabsorve en varios meses. Como tratamiento médico podemos \naconsejar una dieta baja en grasa, aunque no se han observado reducciónes del quilo en \nestudios experimentales. Por otro lado, la administración de benzopironas (rutina) puede \nmejorar la función de macrofagos y aumentar la absorción de quilo del espacio pleural (rutina \n50-100 mg/kg 8 h). \nEl tramiento quirúrgico se basa en tratar la causa primaria, resección de masas, toma de \nbiopsias, resección pericárdio, reseccionar lóbulos pulmonares torsionados, entre otras. Ante \nun caso de quilotórax idiopático podemos realizar una pericardiectomía junto con una \nomentalización de la cavidad pleural. También se ha propuesto realizar una ligadura del \nconducto torácico aunque se considera una técnica compleja debido a la dificultad de \nvisualización de éste.    \n  \n\n--- Page 21 ---\nBibliografía:  \n \n1.
