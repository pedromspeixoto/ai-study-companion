Initial, small-scale \nautomations grow to support large-scale \norchestration needs. Eventually, \norganizations recognize the need for \ndedicated ownership—a team or individual \ntasked with building and maintaining a \nscalable platform to support their \nautomation and data pipeline requirements.\nWhile organizations may have very similar \ndata needs, headcount, and workflows, it’s \ncommon for the platforms they build to be \nsignificantly different. This is because no \ndistinct solution exists for building a data \nplatform. This can come down to decisions \nabout their cloud provider, preference for \nopen or closed-source software, and budget. \nAlthough the underlying technologies \nmay be unique, these organizations often \nfollow common, well-known patterns and \nprinciples to design their data platforms. \nWe will review some of those patterns and \nprinciples in this e-book. \nDagster believes in an open data platform \nthat is heterogeneous and centralized. It \nshould support specific business use cases \nand accommodate various data storage \nand processing tools, all while providing a \ncentral unified control plane across all of the \nprocesses in the organization.\nIntroduction\nOnly one data platform should exist in an \norganization. While a single platform may \nrequire a larger upfront investment, the \nstandardization it provides and productivity \nboost for the team pay dividends as the \nplatform grows.\nAn extensible platform provides better \nbusiness alignment and less duplicated work. \nFor more information on what Dagster believes \nabout data platforms, see the “What Dagster \nBelieves About Data Platforms”  blog post.\nThis book will be a comprehensive guide \nfor data platform owners looking to build a \nstable and scalable data platform, starting \nwith the fundamentals:\nArc hite cting your Data \nPlatform\nDesign Patterns and Tools\nObservability\nData Quality\nFinally, we’ll tie it together with real-world \nexamples illustrating how different teams \nhave built in-house data platforms for \ntheir businesses. \n01 | Data Platforms\n04\n\n--- Page 5 ---\n05\nYou can find the Dagster team’s internal \nOpen Data Platform on GitHub . Throughout \nthis e-book, you’ll see how Dagster’s core \ntenet of building open-source software can \nhelp establish the standards for a scalable, \nmaintainable, and stable data platform.\nThis book is for data practitioners interested \nin building and maintaining a data platform. \nYou may be a team of one or part of an \nestablished team with a growing area of \nresponsibility. In either case, common issues, \npatterns, and needs are core to building a \ndata platform. This book will help you \nnavigate those topics and establish a data \nplatform that evolves alongside your business.\nMost data tools fall into two categories: \nall-in-one solutions or unbundled tools. One \nof the biggest criticisms of the Modern Data \nStack is that its design over-indexes on \nunbundled tools, requiring teams to stitch \ntogether a large number of specialized tech \nto address problems historically managed by \nlarger, managed platforms.\nIs it really necessary to adopt a dozen tools \nto do what was previously managed by \nonly a handful? The problem is not deciding \nwhich tools you need but how to integrate \nthose tools into a cohesive whole.\nAn Open Data Platform\nWhy do we need data platforms?\nUnbundling your entire stack reveals one \nmajor weakness–maintaining consistency \nand control over various tooling choices \nand access points. Addressing this flaw is \nthe fundamental purpose of building a \ndata platform.\nIt helps us bridge the gap between a fully \nunbundled data stack and a singular, closed \nplatform. And it all comes down to the \ncontrol plane.\n01 | Data Platforms\n\n--- Page 6 ---\n06\nThe control plane is more than orchestration. \nFor many orchestrators, the ability to \nschedule and initiate jobs is the bulk of what \nthey provide. Data Platforms require more \nthan that.\nTraditionally, the control plane is used to \nconfigure and activate the data plane. This \nis perhaps the most critical piece of the \ndata platform puzzle. It provides a standard \nof control and enables a single view of all \ninputs into and outputs of your platform.\nThe Control Plane\nThe control plane extends beyond creating \nand modifying datasets; it can connect \nassets across various systems, resources, \nand tools. Knowing if your scheduled job \nfailed or alerted you on a failed data quality \ncheck is only somewhat useful. Knowing \nthe data lineage of that failure downstream \nis far more important than the simple \nobservation that “it failed.” \nThis is the marriage of orchestration, \nmetadata, and observability, and it is the \ncore value-add for most data platforms. \nIn many cases, this requires various tools, \nwhich must be integrated.\n01 | Data Platforms\n\n--- Page 7 ---\n07\nThe flexibility of an unbundled Data Stack \ncan quickly evolve from a value-add initiative \nto a maintenance burden. Separate—though \nintegrated—tools often develop opaque and \nbrittle dependencies. An upstream change may \nhave an unexpected impact far downstream.\nTesting alone is not the solution to making \nsure various tools work well together. The \ntrue culprit is often disparate codebases and \na disjointed developer experience. Many tools \noften mean many repos, poorly documented \ndependencies, and an increasingly complex \nsystem architecture which leads to siloing \nwithin teams and organizations.\nThese are common problems for many \ncompanies and familiar headaches for all \ndata engineers.\nThankfully, a centralized data platform helps \naddress these issues holistically with your \nteam’s and system’s common language: code.\nIn software engineering there is the concept \nof code encapsulation .  This idea is also \nprevalent in establishing a data platform. \nWhile the organization operates within a \nsingle data platform, individual contributors, \nlike data scientists, analysts, data engineers, \nand machine learning engineers, can operate \nwith freedom from within their own \nsubdivisions of the platform.\nData platforms help manage and orchestrate \nworkflows, so it is reasonable to expect “code \nlocations” to include both the logical \ncomponents of a workflow and the \nconfiguration related to that workflow. \nManaging a variety of jobs in disparate \nsystems makes this incredibly difficult. As the \ncomplexity of the jobs grows, this becomes \nincreasingly difficult. A centralized platform \nthat introduces standardized workflow \npatterns and provides a shared interface for \nmultiple jobs is a primary benefit of establishing \na data platform. The enforcement of \nstandards by the platform owner enables \nthem to ensure improved validation and \nsupport of the platform as a whole.\nBenefits of Data Platforms\n01 | Data Platforms\nIn the context of data engineering, \n“code encapsulation”  refers to the \npractice of bundling together the \nfunctions that operate on, and generate, \ndata into a single unit, typically in the \nform of modules or classes. This practice \nhelps in managing code complexity, \nmaintainability, and promoting reusability.\nNote\n--- Page 8 ---\n08\nObservability and developer experience are \ntwo other key benefits of a data platform, \nalongside code locations and encapsulation. \nThey are also the common threads that help \nelevate your pipelines from miscellaneous \ncode sets to a stable and mature platform.\nWe’ll explore these topics in later chapters, \nbut observability can take multiple forms. At \nits core, observability is the ability to \nreasonably inspect what is happening on the \nplatform. This includes changes to your \nsystem inputs, changes in the outputs over \ntime, and other details about the inner \nworkings of your platform. The Data Visibility \nPrimer  is another great resource on this topic.\nThese elements contribute to the \ndeveloper’s experience on the data platform. \nThe biggest pitfall of data platforms - or any \nlarge data infrastructure initiative - is an \ninconsistent experience. This applies to both \nthe creation of new features and datasets \nwithin the platform and the maintenance of \nexisting features and datasets. Without the \nability to share standards across your code \nlocations, and have a clear view of the \nworkings of the platform, your developer \nexperience will suffer. As a result, your \nteam’s velocity will suffer, and your data \nplatform will likely fail to provide the value \nyou expect.\nObservability and Developer \nExperience\n01 | Data Platforms\n\n--- Page 9 ---\nArchitecting \nYour Data \nPlatform\n02\n--- Page 10 ---\n10\nData Platforms often \ncomprise many tools.\nIndependently, these tools solve discrete \nproblems. Collectively, however, they \nprovide the means to solve broader pain \npoints common to data teams and technical \norganizations: inconvenient data silos, poor \ndata quality, and ever-changing stakeholder \nrequirements can make delivering value \ndifficult. But, these challenges can be \naddressed holistically - and preemptively - \nwhen architecting your data platform. \nStrong consideration for system design at \nthe inception of your project is crucial, as \nearly architecture decisions can influence \nthe effectiveness of your platform: for \nexample, risk of vendor lock-in, scalability \nlimitations, and maintenance overhead. \nDesign decisions and tooling selections \nshould also scale with your team’s and your \ncompany’s growth. It can seem daunting \nwhen taken at face value, but established \ndesign patterns make this process much \nmore manageable. \nThis chapter will review the configurations, \ntooling, and architectures that the data \nteam should consider. Whether starting \nfrom square one or rearchitecting a legacy \nsystem, you can set yourself up for success \nby being intentional and thoughtful about \nthe overall system.\n02 | Architecting Your Data Platform\n10\n\n--- Page 11 ---\n11\nData Platforms need to \ngrow and evolve with the \nbusiness. If data platform \ndevelopment stagnates \nwhile the business is still \nchanging, it’s likely a \nbyproduct of poor \narchitecture and overly \nrigid design. \nA centralized data platform is the best way \nto ensure stability and consistency across all \nyour data initiatives. Designing an extensible \nplatform will allow you to keep up with the \nbusiness’s changing demands.\nThe architecture of your platform establishes \nwhich kinds of data access patterns are \npossible for the rest of the organization. The \ndata platform, and data teams, must be able \nto meet the needs of the numerous \nstakeholders across organizational teams. \nThese can manifest as any number of data \ndeliverables, whether those be dashboards, \ndata exports or machine learning models. \nThese expectations need to be understood \nearly on. If you expect consumers to only \ninterface with the platform through BI \ntools, you should facilitate a design that \nensures data is readily available through \nthat entry point. \nIf data is primarily shared via APIs or batch \nexports, your platform should support that \nas a primary feature. These entry points can \nevolve over time, but you should expect to \nsupport any platform’s new entry point for \nthe long term. \nMaking it easy for users to consume data \nthrough a BI tool can be a double-edged \nsword. Often, “self-service” is the goal, but \nwithout strong controls on structure and \naccess, you introduce the possibility of \nmisuse and misinterpretation of the data \nthat’s been made available. Centralized data \nplatforms improve this through transparency \nof data usage, lineage to better understand \ndata origin, and higher quality data through \nend-to-end pipeline validation.\nThese details must be considered when \ndesigning your platform’s internals and \nthe entry points for your customers \nand stakeholders.\nScaling with the Business\n02 | Architecting Your Data Platform\n--- Page 12 ---\n12\nRapidly growing datasets, tightened SLAs, \nand prohibitive costs are common drivers for \nplatform redesign and architecture overhauls. \nA composable and extensible platform \nmakes meeting these requirements possible \nwithout an expensive redesign. \nRequirements often change at organizations \nand the data platform needs to be able to \nreact. A startup may find that as they grow \nand their data volume increases, their initial \nset of tools are no longer able to handle the \nadditional traffic.\nAs the lifespan of the tools within a data \nplatform are tied to the needs of the \nbusiness, the goal should not be to avoid \nplatform changes but to design a \nplatform that makes operating under this \nconstraint manageable.\nComposability and \nExtensibility\n02 | Architecting Your Data Platform\n\n--- Page 13 ---\n13\nIf you build an extensible and composable \nplatform, you can continue to operate at a \nhigh level with minimal downtime. You also \nafford yourself the flexibility of updating \nyour platform without migrating major \nsystem components. \nChanging transformation tooling, pipeline \ndesign, and migrating data stores are common \nactivities for any Data Platform Owner. The \nease with which you can execute those \nchanges depends on the platform’s design.\nWhat does an extensible platform look like \nin the real world? Often, it comes down \nto abstractions. \n02 | Architecting Your Data Platform\nComposability and Extensibility\nIn object-oriented design and \nsoftware architecture, the principle \nto “prefer composition over \ninheritance”  advocates for reusability \nand organization of code over \nheavy reliance on inheritance.  With \ninheritance code can become tightly \ncoupled leading to fragility and \ninflexibility. Whereas with composition, \nthere is a loose coupling between code \nreferences, thus leading to improved \nmaintenance, and often clearer and \nmore understandable code.\nNote\nYou probably have heard the phrase “prefer \ncomposition over inheritance” .  in the \ncontext of software application design. This \napplies to data platform design in much the \nsame way, in that the composition of a data \nplatform typically comprises multiple \npurpose-built tools.\nOften the composition of data tools is \nabstracted and hidden from the downstream \nanalysts, and data engineers, allowing for \nthese individuals to be more efficient in \ncompleting their tasks. Data engineering is \nsoftware engineering after all, and the \ndesign and composition of tools, pipelines, \nand models, should be aligned with software \nengineering best practices.\nComposability and extensibility are key \ncomponents of a well-architected data \nplatform, and something we will cover in \nmore detail later in these writings.\n--- Page 14 ---\n14\nHistorically, data architectures were \nconsiderably simpler than what you see \ntoday. As the data needs of organizations \nhave become more demanding, the underlying \ntechnologies have evolved to meet them: \ndata needs to be more real time, with higher \nvolume, and through more and more \nsophisticated modelling.\nIn recent years, a proliferation of tools has \nemerged to handle the specialized \nrequirements of data processing and modelling, \nand a bundling of these tools has been \ndefined with the name of the “Modern Data \nStack”. Many teams have become frustrated \nwith the modern data stack, and its many \nvendors, and  critics often stress that these \nnew tools introduce undue complexity, and \nsome of those concerns are warranted.\nBut there is no denying that the wide range \nof data tooling has lent itself to a range of \narchitectures previously unavailable. Let’s \nlook at some of those data architectures and \ncritical components of each design.\nExtract-Transform\nLoad (ETL)\nE xtract-Load\nTransform (EL T)\nD ata Lakehouses\nE vent-Driven\nCommon Data Architectures\n02 | Architecting Your Data Platform\n01\n02\n03\n04\n--- Page 15 ---\n15\nThis architecture is the simplest and \noldest approach of this list. Data \nstarts from an origin datastore, often a \nproduction database, and is transformed \nin transit before being written to a final \nstorage mechanism. Typically, you’ll see \naggregations and other denormalization \napplied to these datasets before they are \nwritten to their final destination. \nCommon Data Architectures\n02 | Architecting Your Data Platform\nBy design, the state of the data in its “final” \nform is different from what is extracted from \nits origin. This design is still commonplace, \nand can be quite effective at reducing \ncompute usage at the destination. The \ntradeoff is that you may lose the granularity \nof data, and your downstream usage is \nlimited by the logic applied in transit.\nExtract-Transform-Load (ETL)\n--- Page 16 ---\n16\n02 | Architecting Your Data Platform\nThis design has grown dramatically in \npopularity thanks to the Modern Data Stack \nand its modular design. It has also become \ncommonplace thanks to the advent of \nMassively Parallel Processing databases and \ntheir modern counterparts. \nInstead of applying transformations to your \ndata before it lands in your warehouse, \nyou retain a raw copy of that data as it \narrives. This design pattern lends to various \nextraction methodologies, including change \ndata capture (CDC) and ingestion of data \nfrom APIs or file servers. As an example, \nin the case of CDC, all of the operations \nthat are performed on a dataset, like a \ntable in Postgres, are captured and loaded \ninto storage. Then, that data can be re-\nconstructed in the transformation step, \nreconstituting the original dataset from the \noperations that took place. Comparing this \nto “ETL”, the raw change capture would be \nlost as the transformation would take place \nas the data is loaded into storage.\nBecause the raw data is retained, it is \npossible to recreate the transformations \nand models of this data, ultimately providing \nmore flexibility. But, this also results in \nadditional computation, and increased \nstorage costs.\nCommon Data Architectures\nExtract-Load-Transform (EL T)\n--- Page 17 ---\n17\n02 | Architecting Your Data Platform\nThe Data Lakehouse architecture is relatively \nnew, but its underlying components have \nbeen around for many years. \nData Lakehouses provide the scale of data \nlakes with the structure of data warehouses. \nTheir design allows for large-scale data \nprocessing and storage, with most of the “heavy \nlifting” done outside the data warehouse.\nTypically, data is written to columnar file formats \nlike Parquet and stored in cloud storage like \nS3 or GCS. Recently, Iceberg, Delta, and Hudi \nformats have also been gaining popularity. In \nthe case of Delta, this is an additional layer on \ntop of Parquet in which additional metadata \nand transaction logs are included, enabling \nsupport for ACID (atomicity, consistency, \nisolation, durability) transactions.\nSee a term you’re not \nfamiliar with?

like \nS3 or GCS. Recently, Iceberg, Delta, and Hudi \nformats have also been gaining popularity. In \nthe case of Delta, this is an additional layer on \ntop of Parquet in which additional metadata \nand transaction logs are included, enabling \nsupport for ACID (atomicity, consistency, \nisolation, durability) transactions.\nSee a term you’re not \nfamiliar with? Be sure to \ncheck out the Dagster \ndata engineering glossary.\nThese files typically follow a Medallion \nArchitecture, which we’ll cover in more detail \nlater in this book. These systems often \nuse specialized analytics engines, such as \nSpark, to transform the data in these files \ninto clean and consumable datasets. The \nfinal output is often written for use in a \ndata warehouse or otherwise exposed to \ndownstream consumers. \nCommon Data Architectures\nData Lakehouses\n--- Page 18 ---\n18\n02 | Architecting Your Data Platform\nStreaming and “real-time” data platforms \nblend event-driven design patterns \nwith some of the components of the \narchitectures mentioned above. \nIn an event-driven paradigm, services \nexchange data and initiate their workload \nthrough external triggers rather than relying \non the coordination provided by a signal \norchestrator. Some examples of triggers \ninclude messages landing in a Kafka \nmessage queue, a call to a web hook, or an \nS3 event notification.\nThese architectures often use specialized \ntools to enable steam processing for real-\ntime and rolling-window transformations. \nThis approach is often paired with the \nLakehouse architecture to serve analytical \nworkflows for a wide range of SLAs. \nOften streaming can be paired with batch \nprocessing, in that rolling computations can \ntake place on the event stream, and persisted \nevents landing in cloud storage can be later \nbatch processed for additional reporting.\nSome considerations of stream based \nprocessing is the expected cost of long-\nrunning compute, the additional complexity \nof event processing, and the requirement \nfor specialized tools that may not conform \nto the existing tools being used at your \norganization. However, when real-time \nanalytics are required for insights that need \nto happen fast, like fraud detection, then \nstreaming is a fantastic option.\nCommon Data Architectures\nEvent-Driven\n--- Page 19 ---\n03\nDesign\nPatterns\n--- Page 20 ---\n20\nAs we know, addressing your business’s \ndata needs is at the core of your data \nplatform. To do this, we need to capture \nand process data. Pipeline designs may be \nconstrained by the tools you use within your \nplatform, but don’t be fooled by shiny or new \ntechnologies. There are only a finite number \nof data pipeline patterns that you can use to \nfind, ingest, and process new datasets for \nuse downstream. \nCountless tools can help you process new \ndata, but only a handful of fundamental \npatterns exist. \nWhether your data platform is entirely \nnascent or quite mature, the pipelines \npowering your platform can fall into one of\nthese three categories:\nThere may be layers of abstraction built on top \nof these patterns, but the fundamental \nimplementations will fall into one of these \napproaches. We won’t be going into much \ndepth in this chapter about pipeline \nabstractions, but you can find more details \nabout Dagster’s approach to abstractions here.  \nThese categories are not unique to data \nengineering; any software engineer who has \nworked on system integrations, consumed \nwebhooks from a third-party application, \nor interacted with a REST API should find \nthese familiar. However, certain patterns \ncan be found quite frequently within a data \nplatform, which we have seen through our \nexperiences implementing data platforms \nat various organizations, and through \nrelationships with data tooling customers.\nDesign Patterns for Data \nPipelines\n03 | Design Patterns\n01\n02\n03\nPush\nPull\nPoll\n--- Page 21 ---\n21\nFor pipelines that are based on the push \nmethodology, the consumer is required to \nwait for data to be pushed from a source \nsystem; the destination could be a location in \ncloud storage, an API endpoint, or a database.\nFor push-based systems, the consumer can \ndictate the schema of the data that is being \nreceived, however, a common complexity \nin these systems is synchronization of \nschema definitions between producers and \nconsumers. In these cases, schema registries \ncan come in handy for defining a single source \nof truth for the expected format of data.\nPipelines using a pull methodology have \na slightly different definition of ownership. \nMost notably, the consumer dictates the \ncadence of ingestion. Typically, this happens \non a predefined schedule, though it can also \nbe extended to use an event-driven trigger. \nWe’ll look at how this would work next. \nWith pull based data access patterns, the \nconsumer pulls the data based on the access \npattern of the producer. For example, with a \nREST API, the consumer may have to perform \npagination, and supply query parameters in \na very specific structure. For replication of \ndata in a database, the consumer would be \nresponsible for defining the SQL query for \npulling data, along with the logic for \nincremental loads. Note that tools like dlt \nand Sling support this behavior out-of-the-box.\nAn example pipeline that follows the push \naccess pattern may look like this:\nA process for the producer starts at a \nscheduled time or preset interval\nT he producer performs some form of \nprocessing or creation of data\nT he producer pushes their datasets to \na storage location like S3, GCS, or an \nSFTP Server\nT he consumer ingests that new \ndataset on their own schedule\n01\n02\n03\n04\nAn example pipeline that follows the pull \naccess pattern may look like this:\nThe process starts at a scheduled \ntime or preset interval\nC onsumer job fetches new data \navailable\nC onsumer processes new data \nas needed for integration into the \nplatform\n01\n02\n03\n03 | Design Patterns\nPush\nPull\nDesign Patterns for Data Pipelines\n--- Page 22 ---\n22\n03 | Design Patterns\nDesign Patterns for Data Pipelines\nThe final flavor of the pipeline uses a polling \nparadigm. It can look similar to the pull pattern, \nbut this implementation typically pairs well \nwith event-driven architectures. It requires \nthe consumer to maintain the state in ways \nnot necessarily needed with other designs.\nPolling implementations transfer the cadence \nof ingestion to the consumer. Maintaining a \nstateful pipeline - one knowledgeable of what \ndata it has processed - is critical! Without \nthat knowledge, subsequent runs of the \npipeline may result in duplicate processing \nor unexpected downstream changes.\nHere is a typical poll-based pipeline trigger \nthrough an external webhook:\nMessages are frequently being \npublished to a Kafka message broker\nT he consumer polls this message \nbroker, and processes the records\nI t keeps an identifier or “cursor” of the \nrecord that has most recently been \ncollected\nT he consumer then polls again, at a \nregular interval, providing the “cursor” \nto only retrieve new records\n01\n02\n03\n04\nPoll\n--- Page 23 ---\n23\nMany of the design patterns that were \ndiscussed above benefit from following an \nidempotent design. Idempotency is the idea \nthat an operation, for example a pipeline, \nproduces the same output each time the \nsame set of parameters are provided. This is \noften a great practice in designing data \npipelines as it creates consistency in \nprocessing jobs, but it is especially important \nfor the poll based data access pattern.\nDeterministic systems in software \nengineering is the expectation that the \noutput of a function is only based on its \ninputs. There are no hidden state changes as \na result of calling that function. \nFor example let’s look at two snippets of \nPython code, one which is idempotent, and \nthe other that is not.\nIn this example, the non_deterministic_\nfunction is taking a location and destination \nparameter, and writing the current \ntemperature to a file. Each time this function \nis called, the output will be different, as it \nrelies on an always changing metric being \nreturned from the MyWeatherService.\nNow, let’s compare that to something that \nis idempotent.\nIdempotency\n03 | Design Patterns\nPython\nPython\ndef  current_temperature(location:  str ) -> int :\n return  MyWeatherService().get_current_temperature(location)\ndef  non_idempotent_function(location: str , destination:  str ) ->  None :\n with open (destination,  ‘w’ ) as  f:\n  f.write(current_temperature(location))\ndef  get_temperature(timestamp:  str , location:  str ) ->  int :\n return  MyWeatherService().get_temperature(location, timestamp)\ndef  idempotent_function(timestamp:  str , location:  str , destination:  str ) ->  None :\n with open (destination,  ‘w’ )  as  f:\n  f.write(get_temperature(timestamp, location))\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nIdempotent\nNot Idempotent\n--- Page 24 ---\n24\nThis example differs in that our idempotent_\nfunction requires a timestamp parameter. So \ninstead of getting the temperature at a given \nlocation at the time the function is called, \nwe are responsible for explicitly providing \nthe time, and each time this function is \ncalled with that specific timestamp, it should \nreturn the same value.\nPractically, you want your pipelines to produce \nthe same result given the same context. \nMaking this happen - or failing to do so - \nis often at the root of pipeline complexity. \nThe means of doing this can be relatively \nsimple. At its most basic, this may mean \nrecording IDs, filenames, or anything that \nuniquely identifies your input data that has \nalready been processed by the data pipeline. \nThis can often be done by leveraging the \ncontext of an orchestrator, for example, the \ntrigger time of a pipeline, or the categorical \npartition data that can be used as a \nparameter to your processing code.\nFor instance, when running a batch pipeline \ndaily, each execution would not look at the \nlast 24 hours of data. Instead, it would use a \nspecific 24-hour period between two \nspecific “bookends.” \nBy using an explicit window of time rather \nthan something relative to the execution of \nthe job, you remove one potential cause of \npipeline drift. Even the best orchestrators \ncan be resource-constrained. Also, reducing \nyour exposure to slightly delayed jobs is a \nsmall but essential implementation detail as \nyour platform grows. \n03 | Design Patterns\nIdempotency\nPython\n@asset(\n    partitions_def=DailyPartitionsDefinition(start_date=» 2024-10-01 »)\n)\ndef  daily_partitioned_events(context: AssetExecutionContext)\n    «»» Each execution of this asset is configured to be tied to a specific\n    day, thanks to the DailyPartitionsDefinition.

Both topics are \nincredibly vast - and beyond the \nscope of this chapter. But whether \nyou are implementing a Data \nLakehouse, Data Lake, or Data \nWarehouse as the central data store \nfor your platform, you will find many \nsimilarities in their structures. \n26\n\n--- Page 27 ---\n27\nY ou’ve probably heard of the Medallion \nArchitecture. While the term may be most \ncommonly associated with Data Lakehouse \narchitectures, the core concepts are essentially \nthe same as those commonly found in Data \nWarehouses that follow an EL T design. \nA Medallion Architecture’s fundamental \nconcept is to ensure data isolation at \nspecific points in its lifecycle. You’ll often \nhear the terms “bronze”, “silver” and “gold” \nused to describe this lifecycle. \nIn a data warehouse context, you may see \n“staged”, “core” and “data mart”. Some \nothers use “raw”, “transformed”, and \n“production”. Regardless of the terminology \nused, the buckets have semantic and \nfunctional significance.\nConsumers typically want clean, well-\nstructured data. This may not be the case \nwhen working with LLMs or other flavors of \nML models, but business use cases always \nexpect clean and structured data.\nA Medallion Architecture makes this \nrelatively easy to manage and understand. \nThis general pattern is very good at reducing \nthe downstream impact of reporting through \nseparation of data ingestion, cleaning, and \nconsumer-ready datasets; it also pairs \nwith data governance and data security. \nCompartmentalization is a core concept.\nLakehouse architectures typically apply this \nstructure to files stored in cloud storage \nservices like S3 or GCS. But, this structure \nis not always necessary, and can be overly \ncomplex for many businesses. Instead, you \ncan apply these same logical distinctions \nwithin your data warehouse. Companies \nfollowing a Lakehouse architecture often \npush the Gold layer into a data warehouse \nfor easier consumption by BI Tools and \nbusiness users.\nBronze • Raw data is stored as it is \nreceived. Ingested data may be \nschemaless\n• Often called a “Landing Zone”\nSilver • Cleaned and structured datasets \nderived from the Bronze layer\n• Primary validation layer for data \nquality\nGold • Consumer-ready datasets\n• May include pre-processed \naggregates and metrics\n• Consumers may be business \nusers, applications, or other data \nstores\n04 | Data Modeling\n--- Page 28 ---\n28\nWhere the Lakehouse architecture uses \nstructured cloud storage service buckets, \na data warehouse would instead segregate \nthese datasets by schema. \nModern warehouses like BigQuery, \nDatabricks, Snowflake, and Clickhouse \nare blurring the boundaries between Data \nLakehouse and Data Warehouse. Regardless \nof your technology choice, segregating \nyour data based on how well it has been \nvalidated, cleaned, and transformed is \nalways a good decision. \nA bonus of this structure is the separation \nof reads and writes. Though it adds some \noverhead, separating these two operations \nallows for a more stable platform for a few \nreasons. This separation sets the foundation \nfor more complex CI/CD workflows like \nBlue/ Green Deployments. It also enables \nour platform to be resilient to upstream \nchanges. You’ll be hard-pressed to find \na data engineer who has not dealt with \nunexpected source data changes or has \nnot had to combine “legacy” and “modern” \ndatasets into one table. Doing so without \nseparating reading data and writing data is \nvery difficult.\nHopefully, it will seem obvious that raw \ndata can be captured in one place and \nmaterialized as clean data elsewhere. This \nsingle design decision will save you many \nhours of future headaches. Remember, your \ncurrent data architecture has a finite lifespan \nand will evolve. You also should expect \nyour input data to change over time. This is \nespecially true when consuming data from \na transactional database. Isolating raw data \nallows you to abstract away the processing \nneeded for handling miscellaneous edge \ncases or combining legacy datasets with \ntheir current versions. You cannot always \nrely on upstream systems to provide \nconsistent input data; instead, you should \ndesign your data platform to accommodate \nthese inevitable changes. \n04 | Data Modeling\n\n--- Page 29 ---\n29\nA well-configured platform makes building a \ncomposable and extensible data platform \neasier, but what constitutes “well-configured”? \nRegardless of your data platform’s stage of \nmaturity, you should be designing a system \nthat addresses specific use cases for your \nteam. This will require supporting common \nfunctionality typically found within mature \nsoftware products. Some of that functionality \nmay be bespoke, some from OSS tools, and \nsome from paid vendor tooling. \nWell-configured platforms avoid vendor \nlock-in. To a lesser degree, they may also \navoid “tooling” lock-in. In the extreme case, \nthey may even limit your dependency on any \nsingle tool in the entire system.\nAvoiding lock-in applies to paid software \nsolutions and open-source tooling choices. \nThere are plenty of “modern” data tools, and \nevery tool category has many options. \nMaintaining your ability to change data \npipeline vendors, transformation tooling, or \nreporting and metrics layers provides a \nreasonable level of “future-proofing” without \nrequiring a large upfront investment. \nSo, what components should we consider \nwhen designing our future-proofed data \nplatform?\nAt a high level, your data platform is likely to incorporate tooling for the \nfollowing components:\n01\n02\n03\n04\n05\n06\n07\n08\nDesigning a Well-Configured \nPlatform\n04 | Data Modeling\nOrchestration Ingestion\nData Cataloging Transformation\nStorage Observability\nReplication Data Versioning\n--- Page 30 ---\n30\nYou might find that a single tool covers \nmore than one of these categories. But you \ncan certainly find specialized tools for each \ncomponent as well. \nAdditionally, as platforms evolve, you may \nfind that multiple solutions are required for \nany given category. For example, you may \nrequire storage in multiple cloud providers, \nOrchestrators vary greatly, but they all allow you to automatically execute a series \nof steps and track the results. Typically, they coordinate the inputs and outputs of \nyour platform.\nPopular \nChoices:\nObservation and tagging of your data is crucial so that stakeholders and analysts can \nbetter understand the data that they use day-to-day.

By themselves, they are \nspecialized technology choices that may \nnot fit well within your organization. But, \nwhen combined into a data platform, they \nform a mutually exclusive and collectively \nexhaustive set of features that provide a \nstrong foundation for platform development. \nThe key to going from just a collection of \ntools to an effective platform is incorporating \nthese tools within well-understood design \npatterns and architectures. And that topic is \ncoming up shortly.\n04 | Data Modeling\nDesigning a Well-Configured Platform\nWhen working in different environments, or as your data evolves, it can be nice to \nmaintain a history of the changes being made. Data versioning tools can provide a \nlayer on top of your data storage to enable this functionality.\nPopular \nChoices:\nData Versioning08\n--- Page 34 ---\n34\nThese features can drastically improve the \nreliability of your data platform, for example, \nsome upstream data producers or teams \ncan be unpredictable, or, outages can occur \nfor services or compute environments. \nWithout having these common features, the \ntrust in your data and data platform can be \nsignificantly tarnished. \nRestarting failed pipelines and services, \ninspecting logs, and backfilling datasets are \ncommon, repeated tasks familiar to every \ndata engineer. Before you jump into designing \nhow you’ll process your data inputs, you \nneed to address these fundamental pieces. \nOften these fall under the purview of your \norchestrator, but not always. \nThere are many ways to design a data platform, \nand many pieces that make up that whole. And, \nthough there are plenty of tools available, some \nfeatures should be considered standard. \nThese quality of life features that should be \nrequired within all data systems, and are often \nthe differentiator between a robust data \nplatform from a collection of one-off scripts:\nThese tools help you support the evolution of \nyour technology stack without compromising \nthe standard of software your team expects. \nYou would seldom release an application to \nproduction without runtime logging or observability \ntooling. Data platforms are no different.\nIt should be clear by this point that there are \nmany parts that make the “whole” of a data \nplatform. Whether tools, pipeline design or \ngeneral data architectures, there is no \nshortage of options or decisions to make. \nBut don’t get confused - many of the tools \nand topics we covered in this book \ncomplement one another. The data pipeline \ndesigns we covered are not mutually exclusive, \nand can be used alongside one another. \nMost of these patterns are just specific \nnames for familiar and common activities \nfound in countless software applications. \nDesigning an effective data platform from \nscratch can be challenging, and there are many \ncontradictory examples online. But rather \nthan focusing on tool selection and losing \nthe forest for the trees, it’s critical that you \nrecognize the components of your data \nplatform are tools to solve various problems. \nOften, teams in and across organizations are \nsolving very similar problems.

Defining these standards \noften originates from the governance team. However, it is \noften a cross-organization and multi-team collaboration \nfor well-defined data quality standards. Many rules come \nfrom the stakeholders who have expertise in the underlying \ndata and reporting needs, but it is often common for \nthese stakeholders too to not have a full understanding \nof the origin of their data. This is why it’s important for the \ndefinitions of data quality to be a result of a team effort.\nData is used to both run and improve \nthe ways that the organization \nachieves their business objectives \n… [data quality ensures that] data \nis of sufficient quality to meet the \nbusiness needs.\nD avid Loshin\nThe Practitioner’s Guide to Data Quality Improvement\nA core component of data platforms is data quality, or \nmore appropriately, a framework for enforcing data quality \nstandards on the data produced by the pipelines in the data \nplatform. This is because data quality metrics are indicators \nthat are used to determine if data is suitable for use in \ndecision-making.\n36\n\n--- Page 37 ---\n37\nThere exist 6-commonly defined \ndimensions for defining rules of data quality. \nThese include: timeliness, completeness, \naccuracy, validity, uniqueness \nand  consistency.\nTimeliness refers to how up-to-date data \nis. If data is being produced by an upstream \nsystem every hour, and the downstream \nmodels haven’t been updated in the past \nweek, then this report is not timely. On the \ncontrary, if you have data being produced \nhourly, and the replication and modeling of \nthat data triggering just after it is produced, \nthen that is a timely pipeline.\ndate_week_end date_report_received status\n2025-01-01 2025-01-01 ON_TIME\n2025-01-08 2025-01-08 ON_TIME\n2025-01-15 2025-01-15 ON_TIME\n2025-01-22 NULL MISSING\n2025-01-29 NULL MISSING\nExample:  An organization expects a \nfinancial report to land in an S3 bucket on \na weekly basis, however, this report hasn’t \nbeen received for the past month\nImpact:  Data not received within the \nexpected latency window can result in \noperational impacts and inaccuracies in \nanalysis and reporting\nThe Dimensions of Data \nTimeliness\nThese dimensions can be referenced \nin defining rules of data quality and \nimplementing quality checks.\n05 | Data Quality\n\n--- Page 38 ---\nNo required field should be missing for a record \nof data, whether that be a column in a database \ntable, or an attribute of new-line delimited \nJSON.

However, \nthe enforcement of rules should remain \nconsistent across tools.\nA non-exhaustive list of tools that we’ve found \nto be prevalent in data platforms includes:\nData quality testing for \nSQL-, Spark-, and Pandas-\naccessible data\nGeneral purpose data \nvalidation tool with built-in \nrulesets\nLibrary built on top of Apache \nSpark for defining “unit tests \nfor data”, which measure data \nquality in large datasets\nAssertions you make about \nyour models and other \nresources in your dbt project\nAsset checks\nA benefit of tools like Soda and Great \nExpectations is that they provide a large set \nof rules out-of-the-box. Instead of having to \nwrite custom logic for validating the 6 data \ndimensions that were previously mentioned, \nit is possible to apply the logic of already \nexisting rules.\nUltimately, it’s important to choose the data \nquality framework that is most appropriate \nfor the other tools in your data platform, \nand it is perfectly acceptable to compose \nmultiple tools that suit your needs. But it’s \nimportant to design your platform in such \na way that you have a central observation \nlayer over these disparate tools and \nframeworks, likely done at the orchestrator, \nso that the stakeholders can have a strong \nunderstanding and confidence in their data.\nTools and Technologies\n05 | Data Quality\n\n--- Page 42 ---\n42\nIt should be noted that the enforcement of \ndata quality should occur throughout all \nstages of the data lifecycle. This includes \nthe application layer, data replication, the \nanalytical layer, and reporting.\nTo provide an example, imagine you are a \nSaaS company that maintains a list of their \nusers. The e-mail address that is provided by \nthe user should be verified at the application \nlayer, both the client side and server side.\nWhen this data is replicated in an analytical \nwarehouse, validation should also occur to \nensure that the data that is present in the \nwarehouse matches what exists in the \nsource database table. It is important to \nensure that the record exists and that no \nduplicate records have been created from \nsome faulty replication logic. Additionally, while \nthe e-mail address should be structured in a \nvalid format for an e-mail address, for \ndefensive data quality enforcement, the \nstructure of the address should also be \nvalidated at the warehouse layer.\nIn the analytical layer, it is common for many \ndownstream models to be produced that \nreference application data, like this user table. \nIt’s important to validate that the \nrepresentation of this user is accurate and \nthat there are no faults in how these models \nare being formed or how this data is being \njoined with other datasets. This can be \nparticularly tricky as data from many \ndatasets come together.\nFinally, these models will likely be surfaced \nin some kind of way, whether that be \nthrough dashboards, some kind of alerting, \nor through reverse-ETL loaded back into the \napplication database. It is important to \nvalidate that the data being surfaced meets \nthe expectations of the business.\nThe full data lifecycle\nEnforcement of Data Quality\n05 | Data Quality\n\n--- Page 43 ---\n43\nWhen constructing a data platform, having \na central control plane, like an orchestrator, \nmakes it much easier to enforce data quality \nstandards at a high level and throughout all \nstages of the data lifecycle.\nThere are several benefits to this approach, \none being that the data platform owner \ncan act as the overseer to the standards. \nIf the organization has a number of teams, \neach with its own set of rules, these can \nbe consolidated into a single playbook for \nenforcing standards by the data platform \nowner through the orchestrator.\nAdditionally, the orchestrator is responsible \nfor determining which jobs should run, if any \ndata quality issues arise, it has control over \nthe downstream jobs that may surface data \nto a dashboard or application. By having full \nvisibility into the quality of data at the various \npoints of its life in the orchestrator, reporting \nof this problematic data can be prevented.\nFinally, the orchestrator is also home to \nsystem-wide alerting, along with updating \nof data in data catalogs. The orchestrator \ncan keep the engineers and platform owners \ninformed of problematic data in a standard \nway for on-call duties.\n05 | Data Quality\nEnforcement of Data Quality\nA central control plane \n(orchestrator)\n--- Page 44 ---\nExample \nData \nPlatforms\n06\n--- Page 45 ---\n45\nTo better understand how one \nmight architect a data platform, \nlet’s walk through several example \ndata platform stacks. In these \nexamples, we outline the origin \nof data, the warehouse, and the \norchestrator, how data is ingested, \nhow it’s transformed, and what is \nused for reporting. There are many \nways to architect a data platform; \nhowever, these examples provide \na referential starting point.\n45\n\n--- Page 46 ---\n46\nSource Data S3, various third-party \nWarehouse Snowflake\nOrchestrator Dagster\nIngestion Stitch, Sling\nTransformation Framework dbt\nReporting Holisitics\nA hypothetical SaaS company is used by \nthousands of e-commerce stores–their core \napplication uses MySQL for transactional \ndata, and transactional events are captured \nand written to S3 via A WS Kinesis. \nThe company used Stitch to ingest third-\nparty data, but relied on a custom pipeline \norchestrated with Dagster to process and \ningest the data in s3.\nThis traditional E-T-L method allowed \nfor in-transit aggregation, reducing the \ncompute load on the warehouse and limited \nexposure of PII in the pipeline. The decision \nto aggregate in-process was intentional, as \ndownstream users were only interested in \naggregate trends based on the event data. \nThird-party data was processed in the \ntypical E–L-T pattern.\nThe \nLightweight \nData Lake\n06 | Example Data Platforms\n\n--- Page 47 ---\n47\nSource Data Postgres (Cloud SQL)\nWarehouse BigQuery\nOrchestrator Airflow (Cloud Composer)\nIngestion Custom, DataStream\nTransformation Framework DataForm\nReporting Looker\nThis company opted for a simple GCP-native \narchitecture due to its existing usage of GCP . \nThis stack leans heavily toward simplicity \nand convenience, favoring readily available \ntools rather than third-party vendors.\nA common practice is to use Airflow (Cloud \nComposer, in this case) for simple E/L \noperations that rely on simple SQL queries. \nThis works fine for scrappy, fast-paced \ndevelopment but can quickly get out of \nhand. The move to DataStream is a prudent \none, specifically for replicating transactional \ndatabase tables.\nThe \nGCP Stack\n06 | Example Data Platforms\n\n--- Page 48 ---\n48\nSource Data Amazon RDS, DynamoDB, \nWarehouse Redshift\nOrchestrator Airflow (MW AA)\nIngestion Lambda, DMS\nTransformation Framework A WS Glue\nReporting  Amazon QuickSight\nIn this stack we’ve elected to use the \nservices explicitly provided by Amazon, \nwith source data coming from DynamoDB \nand Amazon RDS, and replication occurring \nthrough custom Lambda processing and \nA WS DMS.
